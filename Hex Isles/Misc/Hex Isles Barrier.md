The Barrier surrounding Hex Isles after [[Ruby Goldwater]]s death. 

The barrier, also referred to as "the veil", is comprised entirely of magic. All can enter, none can leave. The veil has 3 parts.

1st Part: Magic shell. This part absorbs magic directly from the air, giving it and the rest of the parts a regenerative capability. This shell is made from both Arcane and Divine magic (along with typeless magic like that of Artificers), meaning it absorbs all spells, spell-like abilities, invocations, etc. Beings of a divine rank more than 0 can partly bypass the barriers "no exit" functionality, though their abilities are greatly weakened. This can be circumvented if a deity exists solely or primarily within Hex Isles, such as [[That Fire Deity]]. 

2nd Part: Physical shell. Absorbs physical damage and blocks exit. 

3rd Part: Psionic Shell. Weakest of the shells; a biproduct of [[Ruby Goldwater]]s mental instability during their death. Corrupts psionic abilities, causing psychosis, insanity, and/or extreme mental degradation or comatosis. Despite this, [[The Head Archivist - Evera Stall - Sparrow Goldwater|some people]] have used this to get psionic powers outside of Hex Isles.
