Intended Session: 20

# Part One of Session

"...Architect."
"Staffer."

The party makes their way to the [[Choosing Ceremony]], with [[Espes]] as their protector from [[Arcanas Staff]] and [[Trash Hunter]] as their protector from [[The Architects]]. 

**Physical Description (Outside):**
The building stands tall, made of fine wood and chiseled stone. You can probably notice that there's a small part of each factions Aesthetic, either in the surroundings or on the building itself. There's a garden and some general greenery around the building, with each of the quadrants representing a different season. Burning coals are set along either side of the walkway up to the main doors; even 

The traditional ceremony held for all new members of Hex Isles, where they choose the faction they wish to be beholden to. This specific [[Choosing Ceremony]] is for [[Akane]], [[Tigoon]], [[V-1]], Cyn, and [[Sandalphon]].

Lead Speaker is [[Monasteel Kacee]]

"I thank everyone's faction representative for coming here, and putting aside their opinions towards each other for the sake of our island's new members. As most of you all know, I am Kacee; the lead speaker for this convention."

"Before we start, I will inform those here that a representative from neither [[The Architects]] nor [[The Ancients]] could make it here today. The Ancients have told us that they will hear the answer of the newcomers regardless of their presence here, and an [[Unclaimed]] envoy will be sent to inform [[The Architects]] of the choice."

Kacee will then give a brief description of each faction. Arcana's staff first, followed by the architects, the ancients, the planar archives, and ending with the [[Unclaimed]]

Ask players what places they've been to that they need a recap on, and explain that area from Kacee's POV.

Finally, after each faction has been given their brief summary,
"And finally, there are the [[Unclaimed]], who I represent. Those who do not wish to join a faction, at least officially, will be recognized as [[Unclaimed]]. While the factions we have specified today cover roughly 90% of the islands ground, areas in the sky and some underground areas are not under their jurisdiction, and thus is where most [[Unclaimed]] individuals stay."

"Now, Newcomers, ask your questions now, or hold them until after your choice. Faction choice is a semi-final decision. If you wish to change, you will have to go through the process as defined by the faction your joining, like any other creature of this island."

Pause.

"Now, each newcomer will be called up to the podium, and state their choice in faction."

Order is: **[[Akane]]**, **Cyn**, **[[Sandalphon]]**, **[[Tigoon]]**, and **[[V-1]]**.

[[Akane]] Chose:
**Cyn** Chose:
[[Sandalphon]] Chose:
[[Tigoon]] Chose:
[[V-1]] Chose:

After everyone has chosen and the ceremony is wrapping up, knock them into the area resembling [[Tigoon]]'s [[Narrative Space]]. Pitch black, no one else can be seen except for the silhouettes of the party members. (No soul strings). 

[[Dain Aetos]]: "Well, looks like we're doing *this* part now!"
