"Pah-Ramn Lands"

Currently apart of unclaimed territory far center north. Due to a divine conflict, the divinity of the area is both highly concentrated and ever shifting, the ground changing hourly between a "hallow" and "unhallow" spell. The mixed emotions this brings to all but the most neutral of sapient creatures is said to drive them to insanity. For a good creature, the bliss and general peacefulness that comes with hallowed ground, and the dread and fear that comes with the unhallow.

Connected in some way with [[Monasteel Kacee]]; TO-DO.
