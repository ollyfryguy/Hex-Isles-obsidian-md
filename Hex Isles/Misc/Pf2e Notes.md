**Persistent Damage:**
Persistent damage is taken at the end of each of the creature's turns. After damage is taken, make a DC 15 flat check; on a succeed or critical succeed, recover from the persistent damage. On a fail, continue to take the damage.

**You and your eidolon share your actions and multiple attack penalty**. Each round, you can use any of your actions (including reactions and free actions) for yourself or your eidolon. You coordinate your actions with your eidolon more efficiently when you Act Together.
