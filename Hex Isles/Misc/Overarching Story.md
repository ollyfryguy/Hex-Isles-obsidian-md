Main Story Beats:
This will be detailing how the main plot will be going, starting from after/during [[Session 6 - Destabilization]]/[[Session 7 - Destabilization Cont]].

[[Elizabeth Dun]] finds a forbidden book discussing the manifestation and utilization of fear, though its above her (his?) [[Honor]] level. She suddenly feels like she's being watched and hears a voice ([[Vix Leitner]]) say "Soon." before she blacks out.
[[Nova]], still asleep in the hospital, has a nightmare. They look to be in some sort of grave yard of sorts, as the dark, ashen sky shines faintly onto some of the grave stones. After wandering for a bit they see a collection of graves as a wave of uneasiness washes over them. Its the graves of [[Great Fears|The Great Fears]]. As they stare, seemingly entranced by the graves, they hear the distinctive noise of  stone cracking before they awake. Both awake in the [[Session 6 - Destabilization|Mausoleum]] and the session continues normally.
(More in depth info regarding this can be found in [[Session 7 - Destabilization Cont|Session 7]])

[[Nothzarai Yull]] will attempt to get closer to them; providing them an ally. Eventually, once the party gets comfortable with him, he will be replaced by the [[Falseness]]. "Turning" into [[Not-Nothzarai]].
