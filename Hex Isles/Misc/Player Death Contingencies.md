In case certain player characters "die" in combat, here's the event(s) that happen(s).

# Tigoon
As [[Tigoon]] dies, he's left with a significant [[Soul]] remainder percentage (33%). He enters the [[Narrative Space]], though instead of seeing everyone else's souls, he sees only his.

The diamond, his soul, is heavily cracked, pieces falling off and floating upwards to a blinding white void above him. The more the soul breaks apart, the more he can feel his vision and senses fading, even in this space.

And then right as his vision is about to fade completely, he sees a light in the void. A pink, glowing shard. The exact same shape as a [[Soul Crystal]]. And then another one, aquamarine. And another, and another, until the entire space is filled with dazzling lights.

The pink crystal goes first, floating down to the mass that used to be Tigoon's diamond shaped soul. It proceeds to float into it and click into place, fusing into the mass. And then the next shard does the same. And the next, and the next. And as he feels his vision coming back, senses reheightening, he gazes upon a newly constructed diamond. Glowing with many distinct, separate colors.

And, finally, he feels himself waking up.
