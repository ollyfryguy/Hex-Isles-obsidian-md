#Architects 

**Description**
The artifact of [[The Architects]]. A failed, complex machine running on [[Soul Crystal]]s to attempt to bestow material immortality onto [[Ushanka]]. The actual artifact, which is powering this machine, is located in the center of the machine and appears as a journal, surrounded and covered by crushed [[Soul Crystal]]s.

The journal lists the time and date every person on Hex Isles will die, with those times and dates constantly changing, depending on the circumstances of each individual person. [[Ushanka]]'s date and time simply read "?".
