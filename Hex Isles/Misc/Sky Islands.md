A set of floating islands, which serves as the only major [[Unclaimed]] friendly (though most other places are neutral) city. Due to an ongoing deal with some of the [[Fall (Faction)|Fall's]] from [[The Ancients]], the [[Sky Islands]] don't have a particular geographic location. Instead, they are accessed through the act of falling. If an [[Unclaimed]] person wants to access the islands, they simply need to fall off a building or structure at least 30 feet tall, while thinking from the moment of no contact about transportation to the sky islands. Alternatively, flying creatures or individuals can fly into the sky while thinking of the islands and be transported there as well.

Description:
"The first thing you notice is that the are seems set in permanent fall. The leaves on the various trees are amber and gold, and most of the general architecture is set in those kinda brown, earthy tones. Its not overly aggressive, but its certainly noticeable. Overall, It kinda feels like how [[Sector A, Drop Off Point|the Drop Off Point]] feels, but there's a lot less hustle and bustle. Calmer.
