Misc Notes:
Arrival in Hex Isles: During Tigoon's imprisonment, she tried to make a deal with the major factions of Hex Isles for his safety, including [[The Architects]], [[Arcanas Staff]], [[The Ancients]], and [[The Planar Archives]]. During their third expedition, to the Ancients, some of her political enemies, (remember, this was during the civil war) pushed her in, because she had great political power.

To ensure her own safety, became a [[Fae Folk]] willingly, holding a game show for all new mortal travelers of [[The Ancients]], where'd they'd fight to be the last living party.

Had memory wiped of the party during [[Session 15 - Blasphemy]] by the overseeing [[The Seasons|Higherups]] for punishment, as she was going easy on [[Tigoon]]'s party.
