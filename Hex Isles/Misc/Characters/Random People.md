You're a DM. And since your a DM, your gonna be caught off guard occasionally. Maybe your players will go to a nearby, specific shop you didnt write for, or try and talk down these enemies which you're only thinking of as statblocks.

So, you'll need a random NPC from time to time. Thankfully, *The Game Master's Book of Non-Player Characters* by Jeff Ashworth has you covered. 

Originally I was gonna take far too long creating NPCs, but turns out the book listed above works completely fine! Below are the page numbers for the types of NPCs.

**For People Part of BIg Cities, like Starkeep.**
Pg. 49: Common Folk
Pg. 59: Nobles & Leaders
Pg. 74: Lawkeepers and Lawbreakers
Pg. 88: Oddballs & Outsiders
Pg. 98: Random NPC Generator

**For People Part of Small Towns, like... the edges of Arcana's Staff's territory (You need to create and name more towns girll)**
Pg. 105: Common Folk
Pg. 113: Nobles & Leaders
Pg. 126: Lawkeepers and Lawbreakers
Pg. 138: Oddballs & Outsiders
Pg. 148: Random NPC Generator

**For People Part of The Outskirts of Society or Stationed at Solitary Outposts**:
Pg. 155: Common Folk
Pg. 167: Nobles & Leaders
Pg. 179: Lawkeepers and Lawbreakers
Pg. 192: Oddballs & Outsiders
Pg. 200: Random NPC Generator


And below is the list of any NPCs I've used from the aforementioned sources, and during what session. This is to keep track and make sure I dont use the same NPC twice in a place that doesnt make sense, or simply forget my party members have met them while they don't.

| Session Used On (Link) | NPC Used (Name, Pg Number, Brief Description of Location and Actions.) |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|                        |                                                                        |
