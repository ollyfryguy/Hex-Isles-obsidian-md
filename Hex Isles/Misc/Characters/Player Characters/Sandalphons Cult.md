Cult created by [[Sandalphon]].

### Backstory of Sandalphon:
Actual Origin: [[Sandalphon]] was created as a joint experiment by a few Gods of Order. To try and create a being with zero divine affiliation to any particular being, so that it (and clones of it afterwards) could serve as mediators for the Gods more petty disputes. This was attempted by removing the generally recognized concept of "Godhood" from [[Sandalphon]], through carefully cast Memory Alteration and Blockage spells. The definition that they ended up using for Godhood was flawed however, and thus the entire plan backfired. Instead of [[Sandalphon]] treating the Gods as mortals, in his eyes their divine domains and powers coalesced into one being. "God".

The Gods who created [[Sandalphon]] then casted him down to Hex Isles, where they'd hope the least amount of people would find their mistake.

### The Cult
The Cult is a side effect of his backstory. He objectively cannot believe the truth, due to the constant memory alteration and influence that the divine spell still holds on him. So, the brain tries to correct itself into believing what its forced to, through "divine tomes" and other objects of his religion. Hence the bible and everything else.
