### Description:

### Personality:

### Wants:
The payment a [[Summer (Faction)|Summer]] usually asks for is something that makes a person themselves. This Summer specifically enjoys taking emotions as payment. Despite it only taking negative emotions from Lyra, any will do. Just in a big enough quantity that they act differently than without its interference. 

### Misc:
~~As a courtesy, will almost always finish its own rhymes, so that others have an easier time talking to it. You know you've either greatly pissed it off or its exhausted if its not doing so.~~
