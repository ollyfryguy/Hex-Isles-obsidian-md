Cash's new character.

In Agreement/Pact with [[Ferno (Folk)]].

Cash's sent backstory summary:

Rewritten:
Lyra was born and raised in part of [[Sector F, The Falling City]]. Mental instability and illness developed in her teenage years-- Hex Isles, despite being better equipped than most outsiders believe, simply doesn't have the same medical and psychological resources that outside cities possess. After a particularly destructive fight with a visiting member from [[Sector H, The Wickermen|The Wickermen]] (which ironically made Sector F look like The Wickermen for some time as the crop fields were lit ablaze), she was told by [[Poskol Morr]], to, politely, screw off. "You're options are either to leave our sector and seek help elsewhere, or face years of jail time. I'm sorry, but that's the only two options I can give you here."

So, she left. Most places in [[Arcanas Staff]] were a no go; the [[Sectors (Arcanas Staff)|Sectors]] at least liked to remain cordial with each other and didn't want to accept a member who was kicked out of a different sector. [[The Planar Archives|The Scholar's]] were also a no go, for obvious reasons (not that Lyra particularly wanted to go to them regardless). And while [[The Architects]] were a possibility (granted she could get there to begin with), Lyra felt like the crowded space would just... exacerbate her mental state. She was self conscious enough to at least recognize that. So, she left for [[The Ancients]]. 

It wasn't hard to find. No real borders meant that getting there really just consisted of going east from Arcana's Staff until... well, until the tree's started repeating.

She stayed on the move, attempting to adjust to her "new home" as best as she could. She didn't know much about the [[Fae Folk]] before coming here, but she did know that they particularly disliked those who stayed in one place for too long.

On the seventh day -- or, well, after the sky had dimmed seven times -- she found herself wandering through a forest. Large, oak trees towered impossibly high up, pale like they were diseased, as ash fell from the branches above like a poor excuse for snow. All the while an ambient heat surrounded her; the kind of muggy, all encompassing heat that, while not unbearable, never let her truly get a moments rest, as sweat slowly formed and dripped off.

"Hello there, Lyra Nettin!" A cheery voice sounded from behind her.

Whipping around, she came face to face with... some kind of animal, sat on one of the tree's lowered branches.

It was vaguely feline. Ashen gray, much like the ground below, with a set of long ears and tail which seemed to flicker in the light, like a dying ember. It sat patiently, staring into her eye's, its a little too big, with pupils a little too wide.

She could hear the crackling of fire seemingly emanating from it, like a campfire right after you stir the firewood.

...

Right, speak. "Hi... Folk-- what do you... what are you doing in the forest we are set in?"

The ambient sounds of flame seemed to dim in appreciation.

"Looking for you, of course!" It replied, its mouth not acknowledging the noise. "I want to help you, Lyra."

She opened her mouth to speak, before closing it.

"See, you're strong. Strong enough to help *a lot* of people! But you're emotions sometimes get in the way, right? Annoying things, truly. But see, Lyra, I can help."

"...What do you mean by help?"

"Well, you see what I am, right? We Folk feed on what makes you people "people". And emotions are included in that! So, I can feed on those bad thoughts, shape the others-- make you that person you always wanted to be, all while I get a steady supply of food and a friend! Its a win win, right?"

Its tail grew and extended, billowing out like smoke, before stopping just short of her hand. A crude mimicry of a human handshake.

"So, what do you say, *friend?*"

---

- As the story said, [[Ferno (Folk)|Ferno]] (What Lyra named the Folk after it said it didn't have a name) feeds off Lyra's negative emotions, by choice. All Summer's feed on what makes a person themselves-- all folk do, to an extent, but Summers do so most obviously. So, the act of actually taking the emotions doesn't feed it, but more so the change in personality and choices made that causes. So that Lyra practically "acts like a different person" when being fully fed on.

- Lyra *does* see the thing as a friend, at this point. It hasn't done anything malicious, after all, and its kinda hard to stay wary of a creature that actively drains your wariness away. I'd say they've been travelling together for about a year now.

- Recently (Three days, from the perspective of Lyra), a fragment of Ruby was found in the Ancient's territory. Ferno brought Lyra to it, and explained that this was finally an opportunity to help others in a real capacity. After picking up the gem, she was mentally transported to Ruby's headspace, and was told basically everything during Session 21.
	- Ferno then leads Lyra to a meeting spot it "knows" the party will be going through soon enough, and introductions will play out start of next Hex Isles session.

- After this long of travelling with Ferno, it seems like the Summer's language rule of rhyme has lessened drastically. It still thinks of it as polite to do so, but will tolerate anyone not doing so (unless done maliciously).
