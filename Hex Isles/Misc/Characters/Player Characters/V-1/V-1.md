Played by Damian. Android. Time Traveler, got shot out by a blackhole after a couple millenia and time dilation, *decimating* a town they fell into. Due to the aftereffects of their time dilation, they have some special abilities and feel [[The Ancients|weird in certain places]].

Manifestation Level: 1
Corruption Level: 0

Part of [[Arcanas Staff]]. Specifically [[Sector G, The Staff's Auditorium]].

The being commonly referred to as V-1 is controlled by two souls; V-2 and V-1. V-1, Mark, is in control whenever they are raging/in combat, whereas V-2, Mari, is in control whenever they, well, arent. The souls can communicate to each other and are brother & sister.

During Session 8 (?), after the group went back after their hunt with [[Sector E, Village of Mercenaries|The Village of Mercenaries]], V-1 shut down for the night/went into recharge. Both souls were taken into a dreamscape/demiplane by [[The Hunt]] and, after setting the tone, were asked the question "Do you want to join us?" (Mark was asked something along the lines of "Do you want to be powerful?" first) from a voice in their respective heads. Mark answered with yes, whereas Mari answered with no. Nothing else happened with Mari, but Mark felt a slight thud across their "bag" (not really a bag but shush) where they keep [[Vix Leitner|Vix's]] book. The sigil on [[Vix Leitner|Vix's book]] was slashed out with 3 claw marks, along with the bloodied text "Welcome to the hunters."

Mechanics Wise: Since only one of the souls officially "joined" [[The Hunt]], while V-2 is in control, the effects arent very present, especially at this stage in Corruption and Manifestation. However, avatars of other entities can sense that a hunter is with the party, and any avatars of people with connection to [[The Eye]] can tell its one of the souls in V-1.  However, these are the only effects (at this current power level/corruption level) present when V-2 is in control. When V-1 is in control however, like when they're raging, the effects become more pronounced. 

For convenience sake, even though the rules are listed in [[pdf24_images_merged.pdf]], heres how the abilities work:

**Manifestation Level One:** You are considered trained with all weapons and armor, except for weapons which are both simple and are built into your body, in which case you are considered one proficiency level above what you would have normally (trained --> expert --> master --> legendary). Your gauntlets are considered Adamantine (Standard-Grade), and are increased in dice. They also have a free weapon potency rune (+1) added to them. You also get the Intimidating Strike feat for free, which reads "Your blow not only wounds creatures but also shatters their confidence. Make a melee Strike. If you hit and deal damage, the target is frightened 1, or frightened 2 on a critical hit."; it takes two actions.

**IMPORTANT**:

Damian is disliking his character now due to a mechanics issue. Now that V-1 just left due to [[The Hunt]]'s influence, [[V-1|V-2]] will be the one mainly in control. Who has magic (though not in V-1's form). Have him overtime respec into a magic casting class as [[V-1]] fully looses his influence on his body. :D

Elaborate on idea later.
