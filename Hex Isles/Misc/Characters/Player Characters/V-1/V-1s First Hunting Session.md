Copy and Pasted from the Discord Chat to Moxxie, that was initially copy and pasted from my computer. 2/5/25, initial draft:

30 Minutes Remain Until Night. 
V-1 gives a curt nod to the other people in the camp, before trudging into the nearby forest. Right as he is out of sight, he breaks out into a run, the nearby brambles grabbing hold of his legs before being dragged and tore out of the ground. 

This time, when V-1 is in control, it feels... different. V-1 doesn't quite know how to describe it. Its something more... primal. Suddenly, almost instinctively, he stops, before slowing his stalking, walking with a uncommon carefulness. He also hears that sound from earlier. That steady, beat drum that seems to slowly, loudly sound in the back of his mind. V-1's advance continues through the forest for 10 or so minutes, before he finds his target. An adult fox, small, feeding on a nearby berry bush. It does not notice him.

V-1 could end the hunt right now; complete Vix's weird request or statement and be done with it. But, and looking back, even with hindsight, he cant quite figure out why, he doesn't. Instead, he slowly trudges out of the bushes, staring the fox down with solemn _hunger._ It notices him, and bolts it into the further depths of the forest. The drum grows faster in its rhythm, though still as steady as ever. The hunt truly begins. 

15 Minutes Remain:
V-1 immediately begins chase, running and weaving between the waning branches and fallen leaves with savage abandon. The fox keeps up the sprint, but its movements slow. Its running out of time. He can hear every little sound the forest offers, and above all the fox's pulsing blood and the drum beat fills his sensors. And V-1's thoughts run at a pace equal to his own. Muted; in the way that only instincts are allowed to break through the mental barrier. And quietly, a suppressed thought that the logical side of V-1 knows he should *not* be feeling. 

V-1 knows the prey will suffer as it, or before, it dies. He's sure of it. And V-1 is _glad._ 

10 Minutes Remain:
The chase grows faster; the fox more frantic as it tries to avoid its inevitable fate, the drum once again increasing in speed. V-1 almost thinks he feels those mercenaries' gaze upon him; judging, sizing him up. Its scary—horrifying even. But he also feels that simulated rush of adrenaline, of _manic_ energy. That new—or perhaps it was always there—feeling of bloodlust. 

*Blood, Drum, Chase.*

And he realizes something. 

*Blood, Drum, Chase.* 

Only the strong, the predators of this world, will survive here. That he is sure. (edited)

5 Minutes Remain: 
Closer now, closer still, V-1 knows the hunt is drawing to its end. V-1 purposefully, surgically, stops chasing. He also knows how this will end. 

The fox, exhausted, stops its running as well. Glancing around and seeing nothing, it moves cautiously into a nearby bush to catch its breath. It thinks of itself as safe from the outside, at least for a little. And V-1 stands, completely still behind a nearby tree, hidden from its sight. He aims his railgun towards its head. 

*Blood, Drum, Chase.* 

And V-1 hesitates. 

V-1 does not know why he hesitates, but he does regardless. Maybe... 

This feeling, the rush of energy, the single-minded thought— no, _emotion_ that this hunt is the only thing that truly matters right now. The animalistic drive to kill and satiate and give into the instincts buried inside every sentient lifeform, mechanical or biological. That's why he hesitates. He doesn't want the feeling, the hunt, to end. And that, more than a lot of things, scares him. But... times running out, isn't it? 

1 Minute Remains. 
V-1 makes a lunge towards the fox from his hiding. The fox, too tired to run or dodge, is grabbed in V-1s hands and pinned. The drum roars with its volume, beat ever increasing, as the fox squirms, still futilely trying to do something, *anything*. 

But its no use. 

And as the drum reaches a crescendo of noise and speed, the fox stops its struggle. And it looks at V-1, with a cold knowing in its eyes. 

_Blood, Drum, Chase._

Good.

A sickening crack echoes through the twisted forest as V-1's hand plunges into the fox's neck, shattering the bone with one swift motion as it goes limp in his arms.

Welcome to the hunters.

Revised Draft:
Rewrote first paragraph of 10 minute mark. *Italicized* is the added part.
"The chase grows faster; the fox more frantic as it tries to avoid its inevitable fate, the drum once again growing faster. V-1 almost thinks he feels those mercenaries' gaze upon him; judging, sizing him up. Its scary—horrifying even. But he also feels that simulated rush of adrenaline, of _manic_ energy. That new—or perhaps it was always there—feeling of bloodlust. *He also, behind the ever present drum beat that sets the forest's pace, a motto; a chant; a war cry.*"

"*Blood, Drum, Chase.*"

Also wanted to add some ties to [[The Planar Archives]] for when they finally make it there, and get Damien excited. So, I added this header to the top.

"[[Honor]] requirement: 40"
"This document pertains to the individual known as V-1; part of the [REDACTED] (Cracks), AKA "newcomers", android, and new [REDACTED] (Avatar) of the [REDACTED] (Hunt). Specifically, this document details the hunt gone on by him, simultaneously from his view point and a objective view. Text starts:"

Changed "V-1 suddenly, almost instinctively, stops, before slowing his stalking, walking with a uncommon carefulness." to "V-1 suddenly, almost instinctively, stops, before slowing his advance to a stalk, walking with an uncommon carefulness."

Changed the ending text to be a hyperlink, instead of the text followed by the link. AKA "[Welcome to the hunters.](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxZAXELskA25A1xqNP6hAjVvdm88U5z7HR?si=lOrwrHfYz8VY_JI1 "https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxZAXELskA25A1xqNP6hAjVvdm88U5z7HR?si=lOrwrHfYz8VY_JI1")"

Changed "V-1 doesn't quite know how to describe it. Its something more... primal." to have the ending bit "V-1 doesn't quite know how to describe it. Its something more... primal. *Instinctual*"

Changed that back because I use the word "Instinct" immediately after. Damn

"Suddenly, almost instinctively, he stops." instead of "V-1 suddenly, almost instinctively, stops,..."

Changed "V-1 doesn't quite know how to describe it. Its something more... primal." to "V-1 doesn't quite know how to describe it. Its something more... *natural."



Cant tell if I like the line "Instead, he slowly trudges out of the bushes, staring the fox down with solemn _hunger._", gonna try rewritting it.
"Instead, he slowly trudges out of the bushes, staring the fox down as the forest goes eerily still, for but a moment, as the fox and him make eye contact. Then, just as soon as the stillness ended, the fox bolts it into the further depths of the forest."
Retry of that.
"Instead, he slowly trudges out of the bushes, staring the fox down as the forest goes eerily still. Like everything is waiting in anticipation. 

The fox and him make eye contact. 

And the stillness ends with a forceful finality as the fox bolts it into the further depths of the forest."
Like that last one, using that.

Revised Draft (Version Im Gonna Send Off, So No Links):
Honor requirement: 40
Property of The Planar Archives. Dissemination of high honor documents outside of qualified individuals can and may be considered treason or grounds for a loss of Honor.

This document pertains to the individual known as V-1; part of the ██████, AKA "Newcomers"; android, and new ██████ of the ████. Specifically, this document details the hunt gone on by him, simultaneously from his view point and a objective view. Text starts hereby:

V-1 gives a curt nod to the other people in the camp, before trudging into the nearby forest. Right as he is out of sight, he breaks out into a run, the nearby brambles grabbing hold of his legs before being dragged and tore out of the ground. 

This time, when V-1 is in control, it feels... different. V-1 doesn't quite know how to describe it. Its something more... natural; innate. Suddenly, almost instinctively, he stops. He slows his advance to a stalk, walking with an uncommon carefulness. In his mind he also hears that sound from earlier. That steady, beat drum that seems to slowly, loudly sound in the back of his mind. His advance continues through the forest for 10 or so minutes, before he finds his target. An adult fox, small, feeding on a nearby berry bush. It does not notice him.

V-1 could end the hunt right now; complete Vix's weird request or statement and be done with it. But, and looking back, even with hindsight, he cant quite figure out why, he doesn't. Instead, he slowly trudges out of the bushes, staring the fox down as the forest goes eerily still. Like everything is waiting in anticipation. 

The fox and him make eye contact. 

The drum grows faster in its rhythm, though still as steady, consistent, as ever.

And the stillness ends with a forceful finality as the fox bolts it into the further depths of the forest. The hunt truly begins.

15 Minutes Remain:
V-1 immediately begins chase, running and weaving between the waning branches and fallen leaves with savage abandon. The fox keeps up the sprint, but its movements slow. Its running out of time. He can hear every little sound the forest offers, and above all the fox's pulsing blood and the drum beat fills his sensors. And V-1's thoughts run at a pace equal to his own. Muted; in the way that only instincts are allowed to break through the mental barrier. And quietly, a suppressed thought that the logical side of V-1 knows he should *not* be feeling. 

V-1 knows the prey will suffer as it, or before, it dies. He's sure of it. And V-1 is _glad._ 

10 Minutes Remain:
The chase grows faster; the fox more frantic as it tries to avoid its inevitable fate, the drum once again growing faster. V-1 almost thinks he feels those mercenaries' gaze upon him; judging, sizing him up. Its scary—horrifying even. But he also feels that simulated rush of adrenaline, of _manic_ energy.
