Cash's character. An angel in disguise, formerly a guard of [[Chariot Tyr|Chariot]].

Notes:
Made a deal with [[Aster]] for "combat art" (gladiators alike) in return for divination

Actual Origin: [[Sandalphon]] was created as a joint experiment by a few Gods of Order. To try and create a being with zero divine affiliation to any particular being, so that it (and clones of it afterwards) could serve as mediators for the Gods more petty disputes. This was attempted by removing the generally recognized concept of "Godhood" from [[Sandalphon]], through carefully cast Memory Alteration and Blockage spells. The definition that they ended up using for Godhood was flawed however, and thus the entire plan backfired. Instead of [[Sandalphon]] treating the Gods as mortals, in his eyes their divine domains and powers coalesced into one being. "God".

The Gods who created [[Sandalphon]] then casted him down to Hex Isles, where they'd hope the least amount of people would find their mistake.
