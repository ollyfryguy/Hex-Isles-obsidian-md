Played by Dashel. Kobold. Got sent to Hex Isles after buying bombs for his dad and getting arrested.

### Notes:
Always refers to [[Elizabeth|his mom]] as "mother".
Refers to his Eidolon as "Titan", and treats it as a seperate entity, despite it not being such,
Has a pet named [[Foogoo]]

After touching a [[Soul Crystal]], [[Tigoon]] absorbs the crystal into his being through skin contact. 

With the appropriate amount of concentration (Arcana Check, DC Varies), Tigoon can (currently) see the Souls of people, entering the [[Narrative Space]]. There he can also see the [[Soul Link|connections between souls]], and attempt to (knowingly or unknowingly) abstract them.

### Soul Descriptions

- [[Anyx]]: An orange ball of flame, occasionally flickering.
- [[V-1]]:  Two small (golf ball sized) orbs, one blue and one red, revolving around each other.
	- When in rage (and connected to [[The Hunt]]): Red orb quadruples in size (becoming around dodgeball sized) and stays unmoving in the center of V-1's being. Occasionally, the blue orb can be seen smashing into and promptly bouncing off the red orb.
- [[Trash Hunter]]: An emerald orb, with various cracks in it. Cracks are sealed with varying types of metals.
- [[Espes]]: A pink crystal structure, shards of varying lengths jutting out abruptly all around it. Some places that look like they should have said shards distinctly do not.
- [[Foogoo]]: Either it doesn't have one, or its simply pitch black like the rest of it, and thus unable to be seen.
- [[Sandalphon]]: Three quarters of a sphere. Occasionally, the missing quarter of the sphere seems to regenerate slightly, before being erased.
- [[Nothzarai Yull]]:  A dark blue sphere, with various patterned dots of dark green.
	- [[Not-Nothzarai]]: A white, hollow semi circle, outlined with black.
- [[Akane]]: An orb, mostly royal purple, with the surface occasionally flashing with a bright red.
- Cyn: A glowing yellow ring with a black outline.
- [[Tigoon]]: A baseball sized, very dark blue diamond. The upper chunk of the diamond is pitch black, and you can tell that blackness has seeped into the diamond slightly, almost like a liquid would.
	- That blackness is the partial Abstraction done by [[Foogoo]].
- [[Dain Aetos]]: 2D Fractal spiral, multicolored and constantly shifting.
	- Avatar of [[The Spiral]]
- [[Vix Leitner]]: Scroll reading "Not a high enough [[Honor]] for that, Tigoon."
- [[Chariot Tyr]]: Roughly spherical gemstone, about the size of a baseball, glowing a vibrant purple and pink. The bottom of the gem and the surrounding area seems to have lost its color, and is now a dull grey.
- [[Haspoth Tec]]: A wasp's nest.
	- Avatar of [[The Corruption]]
- [[Liam Osworth]]: Orange and red orb. Claw marks have left visible damage to the outside.
	- Avatar of [[The Hunt]]
- [[Monasteel Kacee]]: N/A; See [[Soul Link]]s section below.
	- Avatar of [[The Web]]
- [[Poskol Morr]]: Soul is roughly person shaped, and larger than his silhouette.
	- Avatar of [[The Vast]]
- [[Roskinov Entreal]]: Blue cube.
	- Avatar of [[The Stranger]]
- [[Tairn Dai]]: Wax sphere, actively, slowing melting.
	- Avatar of [[The Desolation]]


### Soul Links:
- [[Sandalphon]]: One string, towards the sky above.
- [[Tigoon]]: When not melded with Eidolon, one string connecting it with him.
- [[V-1]]: Wrapped around his gauntlets.
- [[Vix Leitner]]: Connected to her eyes.
	- In the narrative space, while she doesn't move, her eyes do track Tigoon.
- [[Liam Osworth]]: Connected to his claws.
- [[Monasteel Kacee]]: Puppet strings, connecting all joints of movement, ascending upwards into the sky. When she moves, they can be seen moving.
- [[Roskinov Entreal]]: Connected to the mask's he gave out to the party.

### [[Soul Link]] Abstraction Description

Initial:
"As you touch one of these strings, you feel a certain energy gather within your body, focusing around that hand. The feeling is reminiscent of when you're casting a spell, when your magic flows through your body, ready for an outlet. And just like you were casting a spell, you feel the ability to release that energy from your hand."

After Abstraction:
"You feel the energy shoot out of your hand, almost like electricity. Jarring, certainty, but not painful. There's no visible display of this happening, and after you slowly retract your hand you're wondering if it even did anything. Until you spot on the string, where the color used to shine brightly, a spot of darkness. Pitch black, like ink-- very similar to that spot of your diamond. And after a few moments, the darkness spreads."
