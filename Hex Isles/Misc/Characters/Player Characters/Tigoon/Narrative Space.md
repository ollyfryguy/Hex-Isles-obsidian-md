The zone able to be entered by [[Tigoon]] (and [[Foogoo]]) during concentration.

Appears as a Pitch-black void, where only the vague outlines of objects and people can be seen. [[Tigoon]] has the ability to see all physical manifestations of [[Soul]]s in line of sight, or within 60ft if line of sight is obstructed. Also sees all available [[Soul Link]]s. [[Soul Crystal]]s are generally invisible unless concentrated on finding, in which case they appear as normal, though glowing softly a random color.
