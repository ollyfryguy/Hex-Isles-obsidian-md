[[Session 16 - Observed Individuals]]

Foogoo is a creature of the "4th dimension". The equivalent of ink on a page. He's more a 'living' part of the narrative then an actual part of the world.

It has the ability to "Abstract" certain things. Offsetting them from the current reality and narrative structure. Like its owner's mallet, which displays all narrative possibilities the creature it strikes is able to perform. Or [[Tigoon]] himself.

Planar Archives File:
- An ink black, slime-like creature, bonded to watched individual "[[Tigoon]]". Acts as a familiar, despite no magic connection between it and Tigoon.
	- (Locked behind [[Honor]] requirement 15): The substance Foogoo is made out of seems to be inherently chaotic. When substance is taken away from Foogoo and injected / coated onto other objects, target object's properties are seemingly randomized. This property has caused the "magical" properties of the mallet [[Tigoon]] holds.
	- (Locked behind [[Honor]] requirement 40): More information could not be found on Foogoo's origins, despite attempts to [[The Eye|behold it divinely.]]
