Homebrew/House rules: Rolling With Emphasis: This homebrew rule was created by GM Brennan Lee Mulligan. The attached image shows the rules of rolling with emphasis![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcr86sgYH4obN8Hkn-Esy5Cifc7FWHJ7DHe_Tc1frcZ4B146_Viwh6ThpSHO0auscFzT8VbWpdqVMW95__atp0abquJVBQ7jpgvBpFHIJE7oDgDF0hnc54N8ielomAVk6XQDeclk2la7z2l99sQZ3HTJgu_?key=a0Eg8BMcrtc7ndmwE9YcSA)

  

2. Rumors: Before session 1 players create 4 rumors about their characters. These can be true, somewhat true, or completely false. At the start of the first session, these rumors are to be randomly handed out to all players, making sure not to give someone rumors about their own character.

  

3. Inspiration: A mechanic featured in the fifth edition of Dungeons and Dragons, Inspiration is given to players by their Dungeon Masters when the player does something "inspiring", or by playing true to their character's personality and flaws. Inspiration gives players an inspiration point, which they can use to gain advantage on most checks. 

  

4. Crunchy Crits: When a critical success is achieved in combat, roll your attack normally and add on the maximum damage your attack could do; if this total is less than if you multiplied your weapon's damage by its critical modifier, then do that instead. For example, let's say you have a quarterstaff and your strength is a +3. First, you would roll your 1d6+3 for your regular damage, in this example getting a 5, and then you would add on 9 damage as that's the max amount of damage 1d6+3 can deal. This damage in total would be 14, which is more than if you had multiplied your weapon's damage normally (5*2 + 3 (Strength)).

  
  
  

# DM and Character Info

All Characters start out at level 3.

No Chaotic Evil characters are allowed, and please talk to me before making a Neutral Evil or Lawful Evil Character.

All characters know only vague rumors about each other, as described above, from being from the same small town before their departure. However, they do not know each other past this and have never spoken to one another.

Content from books other than the core is completely fine, but I will not be using mechanics from those books as a DM unless required by your character. For example, you can be an artificer from the Eberron: Campaign Setting, but I will not be using Action Points from the same book. 

  

This campaign will have more serious roleplay than not; I'm fine with occasional jokes, and of course, it doesn't have to stay grim and in character, but I would like it to be more serious than not.

Please remember that I am a first time DM! I will get things wrong, so try to give me some slack if I mess up occasionally.

  
  
  
  

# World Information: 

Note: This only includes the basic information every character would most likely know.

  

TLDR; Your character is a prisoner, either framed or rightfully imprisoned, who was sentenced to death. Your lawyer found a loophole to avoid your fate, however. From an old policy, you choose to be sent to Hex Isles, an island near Khortan, far south, encompassed by a magical barrier. This barrier serves as a one-way entrance to Hex Isles. To date, no one has been able to leave Hex Isles once entered.

  
  
  

## An Unremarkable Island and The Starred Collective

Hex Isles, a set of three connected, small islands, is controlled by the Khortan Confederacy, a large country located far south, near IRL Argentina. Hex Isles, which at this time did not have an official name, was standard compared to its surrounding landscape; few natural resources and points of interest kept surveillance of the islands low. However, this island caught the attention of Ruby Goldwater, an artificer part of the Starred Collective. The Starred Collective is a statewide organization aiming to implement magic into common society through industrialization and research. 15 of the best researchers and magic users of the Khortan Confederacy were hired on 86 743G. Ruby saw Hex Isles as a prime testing ground for her experiments as it was distant from the Khortan Confederacy while still being within their borders. It went fine for a couple of months. However, Ruby was known for her chaotic experiments, and she knew she would be stopped by her colleagues eventually. So, in an attempt to prevent her experiments from being stopped, she hired a changeling by the name of Tensire to stand in for her in secret, as she continued to do her experiments, now in hiding from the rest of the Starred Collective. On the 57th of the 756th Sunsleep, Hex Isles was imprisoned by a gigantic magical barrier enveloping the island. This barrier acts as a one-way door into Hex Isles. Once entered through, a creature cannot exit through the barrier, either through physical, magical, or extraplanar means. Since the barrier’s materialization, it has not been broken or cracked. Ruby Goldwater has not been seen since.

  
  

## Civil War, Loopholes, and You.

On 54 872G, the prisons were bursting with inmates due to an ongoing civil war. The people of Khortan were rioting against the newfound policies on magic, education, and healthcare. Khortan was relatively peaceful most of the time, and thus the prisons were not meant to be handled in this capacity. Due to this, a new policy was implemented. “If one or multiple inmates are given the death sentence, they can choose to be sent to Hex Isles instead; not being killed.” This was meant to be a temporary way to free up prison slots, as Hex Isles is virtually inescapable. However, due to the chaos of the times, the law was not repealed.  At the current date, you, along with 4 other inmates, are the last prisoners to be sent to Hex Isles before the law is repealed. 

  
  

## Date Keeping System

Years as a specific concept aren't a focus, rather "years" are counted as the four seasons (Sunsleep, Sunwake, Sungaze, Sunrest, for Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall respectively) of length 91 days for each. So rather than "Year 893", you'd have "893rd Sunsleep" or "893rd Sunwake", and so on. An example with the proper date formatting is "18th of the 893rd Sunsleep", or the more common informal shorthand "18 893S" (or W, G, R for the others). The current date of the world is the 62nd of the 893rd Sunrest (Fall) at the time of your departure. Hex Isles was imprisoned on the 57th of the 756th Sunsleep.
