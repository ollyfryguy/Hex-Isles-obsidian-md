The Seasons are the total rulers of [[The Ancients|The Ancient's]] territory, being the essence of some of the ancient god's from First World. While they usually have some relation to the seasons they are named after, this is not always the case.

The seasons, being essentially prototype gods, do not function in the same way as "standard" gods. They do not need, want, or require worshippers, though some do in a vain attempt to curry favor with their controllers. Instead, they act much like factions, each controlling a part of the confusing landscape of [[The Ancients]]. You can, in most circumstances, tell which season is controlling which area by the landscape, and if it matches with the general perception of the season the faction is named after.

The seasons, while they may have internal conflicts over territory, do not care much for outsiders, [[Fae Folk|Folk]] or natural. [[Fae Folk|Folk]] not apart of a season are referred to as [[Unclaimed (Ancients)]]

Due to the almost absolute control [[The Seasons]] have here, [[Great Fears|The Fears]] in almost all cases stay outside of their their territory.

Their language rules apply to themselves as well, and most language rules apply only when "prompted" for lack of a better word. And usually, the language rules can be circumvented by either implying your true meaning, or ignoring. For example, a Summer folk when prompted with a rhyme would have to respond back in a rhyme.

Voices grow distorted during a breaking of their language rules.

[[Summer (Faction)]]
[[Spring (Faction)]]
[[Fall (Faction)]]
[[Winter (Fall)]]

Each faction also has specific punishments and payments. They can also apply general punishments, not listed, though this is less common.
