Group/Faction/Controlling Entity of [[The Seasons]]. Resides in [[The Ancients|The Ancient's]] territory.

Language Rule: Don't ask questions, and don't respond to questions. This means directly questions; making a statement that hints at the question you want to ask is fine. Ex: "We're curious on how you found your friends" as opposed to "How did you find your friends?"

Springs can ask questions, though they dont do it often and only to trick people into answering, finding it "uncomfortable".

[Their question ends in a hard ringing. Aster chuckles.]
ASTER
(distorted)
...Was that a Question?

BOG MONSTER
Your Answers... cannot hurt me...
ASTER
(threatening, predatory)
Are you certain? Would you like to stay and find out?
[The Bog Monster begins to retreat, snarling.]
