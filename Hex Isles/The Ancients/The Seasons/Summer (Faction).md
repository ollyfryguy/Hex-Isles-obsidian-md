Language Rule: Rhyme in conversation. This, like most Houses, applies only when prompted. In "casual" conversation, it does not apply, though its common.

Example text:
SILVER
This is what we would like to take. 
SUMMER ATTENDANT
Hmm... one fear, two heartbreaks. (No prompting, does not "finish" prior rhyming chance.)
SILVER
(under their breath)
You do the heartbreaks, I’ll do the fear. (No prompting)
SUMMER ATTENDANT
Whenever you’re ready. I’m anxious to hear. (Finishes prior rhyme, does not invite further rhyming.)
[Nervous pause lasting several seconds.]
GLASS
My heart broke when my landlord sold the house I lived in.
[Pause.] (No cut in from the Summer, no need to rhyme.)
GLASS
It ached in my chest to be told to my face that my home was not my house. And that my shelter
was worth less than others’.

SUMMER ATTENDANT
