Grouping of people and creatures that are not apart of one of [[The Seasons]]. Resides in [[The Ancients|The Ancient's]] territory. Generally dont have a language rule, instead being more individualized.

"The reason most [[Fae Folk]] are apart of one of the seasons is because its a effective way of feeding. I dont, uh, really know how they feed, but their strategy of confusion with their language rules and everything is generally good. But, some factions, either because of dislike of the system or narcissism, are on their own. We call them unclaimed."
