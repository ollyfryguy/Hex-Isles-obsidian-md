Magic item given to [[Sandalphon]] from [[Aster]]


The deck appears as blank playing cards to everyone but [[Sandalphon]] (and sometimes including Sandalphon if the divination is taken away for whatever reason). [[Sandalphon]] (usually) sees a set of Major Arcana tarot cards, all face down (regardless of what direction he is holding it). When pulled, these can give a rough estimation as to what will happen in a session parallel to the card's usual meaning, [pulled from here](https://labyrinthos.co/blogs/tarot-card-meanings-list/tagged/major-arcana)

[[Sandalphon]] can use these cards as much as they want, technically. However, you are getting these from a [[Fae Folk|Folk]], so it'd be in their best interest to not piss off [[Aster]]

If [[Sandalphon]] tries to give the cards to anyone else, or otherwise lose them from his person, he must make a DC 15 will save or feel mentally unable to give up the cards.
