Also known as Fae Folk Place.

The Ancients are a less conjoined faction. [[Hex Isles Barrier|Hex Isles's Barrier]], while not sentient nor intelligent, realizes when its being tampered with, to a certain degree, and reacts volatilely.. This is part of the reason most factions do not make constant, albeit vain, attempts at breaking the barrier; it realizes, and that usually results in casualties. [[The Ancients]] used to consistently exploit The Barrier's high magic output as a way to power their settlements. After a certain period of time, The Barrier reacted. Theorists suggest it attempted to transport all citizens of The Ancients to [First World](https://2e.aonprd.com/Planes.aspx?ID=35&Redirected=1) (DM's note, pf2e equivalent to the Feywild), but due to its volatile nature, instead transported part of First World into The Ancient's territory, resulting in a morphing between the material plane and First World. 

"First World works on a narrative based system. Highly unstable; not relevant to the 'story', and your gone from... well, existence. Almost every other plane works on a rules based system; physical properties of reality enforce its rules. The Ancients, having blended First World and the Material Plane, melded the two together. Now, physical rules act as more "Suggested guidelines"; if they dont work with the story, they wont apply."



The Ancients does not have a current leader, and technically from a political standpoint, is "unclaimed". Its past leader has either died or been transformed beyond recognition. 

The merging between the material plane and First World has had adverse effects on the area. Some of these effects include:
- **Spatial Inconsistency**.
	- While not on the same degree as [[The Planar Archives|The Planar Archive's]] noneuclideanness, the topology of the area has proven inconsistent. For one, its hard to notice where The Ancient's territory ends (until you've entered it), making most island maps have a "safe zone" around the confirmed territory. Second, backtracking proves difficult, as on occasion following the same path back will take you to a different place.
