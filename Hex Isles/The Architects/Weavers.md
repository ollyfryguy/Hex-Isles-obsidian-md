#Architects 

A past cult of [[The Architects]]. Worshippers of the Goddess [[Pharasma]]

### Ritual Practices
Other than the prayer's to [[Pharasma]], they attempted to imbue themselves with [[Soul Crystal|Soul Shard]]s. [[Augments]] were installed into their skin where [[Soul Crystal]]s could be placed, and supposedly through concentration, their energy harnessed. For more desperate (or poor) sections of the cult, they attempted to consume [[Soul Crystal|Soul Shard]]s-- grinding them up and consuming them with their rations. The injuries caused by this process (as the [[Soul Crystal]]s reformed in their stomach) were considered a test by [[Pharasma]] to see if they were worthy for their divine bestowed role in life, and thus were intentionally not healed.

### Beliefs
The people of the [[Weavers]] believed that [[Pharasma]] was personally bestowing upon them a gift and role. To sew and knit and weave the [[Soul Link|unwraveled strings of silk]], loose from their [[Soul|host.]] For they believed if a [[Soul]] was not whole when its body died, it would struggle to fully move on to the afterlife.
