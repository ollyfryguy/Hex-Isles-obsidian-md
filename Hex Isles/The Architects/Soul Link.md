Anything that consistently interacts with a [[Soul]] creates a link between itself and that [[Soul]]. This includes:
 - Divine connection
 - Possession or alternative control
 - Spell requiring active concentration (aka magical flow from caster to spell)
 - Familiars

These links, if visible, appear like string connecting the soul and target point.

Certain creatures, like [[Tigoon]], can disrupt these.
