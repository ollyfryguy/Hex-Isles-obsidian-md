### Basics
The essence and lifeforce of a particular creature. Usually physically appearing as a sphere-like, colored essence in the center of their being, personified to match its host in some way. (See Soul Appearances in [[Tigoon]]'s note).

When a creature dies, most of the soul immediately leaves the body, appearing in the Ethereal Plane to travel down the River of Souls, to be judged by the goddess Pharasma and sent to their respective afterlife.

However, this process does not result in the full transference of the soul. Depending on the method and circumstances of death, 10 to 30% of a creature's soul can remain in the body after death. This causes the memory and experience gaps most shades experience during the after life. This soul remainder will slowly leak out of the body over the course of a year.

The remainder of the soul left in the body isn't complete enough to reform into anything sustainable, even if the body were to be healed to perfect condition afterwards.

Souls are one of the many methods used to differentiate creatures and other living organisms (such as plants). *Creatures* have souls, *other living things* do not.
### Retrieval
The soul remainder after death is what [[The Ancients]] utilize for their soul collection. Their method is imprecise, only usually able to collect 3 to 5% of the soul remainder of any given creature. Once enough soul is collected its then magically housed and formed into a [[Soul Crystal]].
