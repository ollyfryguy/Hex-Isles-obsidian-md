Physical crystals comprised of the solidified fragments of various [[Soul]]s. Royal purple in color, similar in appearance to amethyst, told apart by a [[Soul Crystal]]'s fragility. [[Soul Crystal]]s are fragile, and with not much strength can be snapped or scratched. However, it naturally coalesces and combines with itself, and unless pieces are forced apart, the break will quickly repair itself.

A soul crystal is usually formed from 7 to 10 separate creatures. Though numbers can range from 3 to 30..

[[Soul Crystal]]'s are short in supply, even within [[The Architects]], and [[Torkin]] itself. There's enough to continue slow production of the various constructs and [[Augments]], but barely.
