Resides primarily in [[The Architects]]. Resembles a mechanoid dragon, with the skull replaced with a spheroid attachment, resembling some modern day cameras. A light can be emitted in a cone of 60ft from it.

Used in Session(s):
 - [[Session 17 - Soul Control]]

Statblock is that of a Toliforged Sentinel, with the following changes:

	Once at 65 HP, gains Enfeebled 2. Fort Save for Tigoon (DC 15) or be blinded for a round. Otherwise, simply be dazzled.

	Exertion Aura is replaced by Fear Aura. Same DC Will Save or become Frightened 1 (Frightened 2 on a critical failure). This fear ends as soon as the creature remains outside of the aura for 1 minute.

	If the Winged Scout's 'programming' is damaged, lower AC to 24. Unless the party majorely screws up, if a Winged Scout is attacking the party of its own volition, its programming is probably damaged/faulty.
