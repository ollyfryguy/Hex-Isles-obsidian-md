### DEPRECATED

Current behind the scenes leader of [[The Architects]]. Basically all choices are now made by [insert acting leader I havent made yet].

Hasent been seen in person for roughly 2 years.

	The grim reaper comes for all. You can stave it off, avoid risk, but it will come for you eventually. And the people who try and avoid it will be the people going down kicking and screaming as they fall. [[Untitled Leader Name]] was one of these people. They were supposed to be better; The original architect; the original designer of all those lifeforms.
	No. They would not go down like this.

[[Ushanka]] put himself into an automaton construct to try and preserve his life (Ushanka from magnus archives/"The angles cut me when I try to think." style). The construct does not have the intelligence nor capabilities to house a human conscience, making them... volatile. He currently resides far underground, making more and more creatures, memories lacking and personality unstable. A secret acting leader makes all intelligence decisions, pretending to be them, though people are starting to catch on that something isnt right, since [[Ushanka]] hasent been seen in a couple of years...
