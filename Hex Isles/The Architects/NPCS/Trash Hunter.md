A 5'5... something. The biological parts left are vaguely human, but also humans kinda look a little like everything else so no one can be quite sure. And its not like he remembers. No permanent home of residence; is either exploring between the layers scouting for parts (trash) or staying with [[Anyx]], helping around the shop (kinda).
