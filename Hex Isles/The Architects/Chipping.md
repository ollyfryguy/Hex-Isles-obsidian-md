The medical process in which a small portion of a (usually willing) creature's soul is removed for storage and the larger scale production of [[Soul Crystal]]s. A process colloquially termed as "Getting chipped." As the damage done to the soul is small, the soul will naturally repair itself over the course of several days to a couple of weeks. Analogous to real world blood donation.

This process is really the only reason the production of [[Soul Crystal]]s is remaining at a constant (slow) pace.
