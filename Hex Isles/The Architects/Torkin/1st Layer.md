#Architects 

The first and uppermost layer of [[Torkin]], the capital city of [[The Architects]]. In rather disarray.

Buildings are as tightly compacted (allegory to Kahloom), and usually rusted or otherwise damaged. Trash fills the cities ground level.

Finding constructs on the surface layer is uncommon, apart from the [[Winged Scout|Scout]]s who watch from their perches, watch areas carved into the mountain side.
