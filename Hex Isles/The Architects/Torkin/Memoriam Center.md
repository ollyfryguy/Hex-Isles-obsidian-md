Located on the [[2nd Layer]] of [[Torkin]].

Looks like a large rectangular tower, with wooden and metal bridges connected to the nearby buildings. Steel letters at all 4 sides of the building, glowing green, read "Memoriam Center". 

Inside are the graves of all the people who have past away on [[2nd Layer|Layer 2]] and [[3rd Layer|Layer 3]]. Each grave is a vertical chamber, set into the building, visible behind a blue tinted glass wall, with the body suspended in the position of sleep, healed fully using magic. Below each chamber is a plaque, stating the person's name, birth and death year, and brief description of who they were as a person.
