#Architects 

"Torr-kin". Referred to as "The Oasis" by denizens of [[The Ancients]]. Generally not referred to by name, on account of there being no ambiguousness about what city in [[The Architects]] a person could be referring to. Outsiders usually refer to the layers by name, whereas the actual populace just refers to them as Layer 1 through 3, with layer 1 being at the top (see below).

The primary city of [[The Architects]], locked behind mountains high enough to reach the top of the [[Hex Isles Barrier]]. The entry to the city is barged by a large, adamantine gate, with two [[Winged Scout]]'s on natural peaks on either side. Should a person be allowed entry, they'll fly down, and shoot their claw hands out to either side, pushing the gate open.

Comprised of 3 (4) layers
- [[1st Layer]]
- [[2nd Layer]]
- [[3rd Layer]]
- [[Maintenance Layer]]

Governmental Structure:
- Limited Anarchy / Military Junta / Aristocracy with Constructs as the ruling class
	- Constructs generally oversee the loose governmental structure. [[Overseer]]s oversee and (get others to) enforce the fundamental rules of [[The Architects]]. Due to [[Overseer]]s power coming directly from their ability to order around the rest of the constructs, their power to impose rules falters at layers closer to the surface (and thus farther away from them and their power).
		- [[1st Layer|Layer 1]] is the loosest in restrictions, being closer to an anarchy than an actual structured system. Basic societal rules enforced.
