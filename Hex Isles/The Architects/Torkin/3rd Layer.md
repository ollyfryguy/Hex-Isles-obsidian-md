#Architects 

The third and lowest *official* layer of [[Torkin]].

The first thing someone notices when entering Layer 3 is the contrast in chaos. Within layers [[1st Layer|1]] and [[2nd Layer|2]], buildings are chaotically placed in shape, trying to take up as much of the lacking amount of space as possible. Like the buildings grew outward from a singular point. In layer 3, while the buildings are still densely packed, there's a greater sense of cohesion here.

There also seems to be a greater focus on aesthetic here. Maybe that's just noticeable because the previous layers had less than nothing in that regard, but you all can spot the occasional decorative mural or recreation center scattered around the plaza.

They specialize in the construction of the Constructs of [[The Architects]]
