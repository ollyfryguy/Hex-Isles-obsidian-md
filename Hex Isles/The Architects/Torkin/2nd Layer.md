#Architects 
The 2nd layer of [[Torkin]], the major city of [[The Architects]].

Looks much the same as Layer 1, with some few key differences. For one, structures seem less dilapidated in comparison to their surface counterparts. Still as dense and compact as above, but more polished, or at least more structurally sound.

The 2nd Layer is focused primarily on the creation of the [[Augments]], along with general production. They receive their [[Soul Crystal]]s from the excess of [[3rd Layer|Layer 3]].
