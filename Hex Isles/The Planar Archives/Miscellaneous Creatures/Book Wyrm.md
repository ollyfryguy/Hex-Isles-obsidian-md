## Book Wyrm – Huge monstrosity, neutral

There are tales of [[Book Wurm]]s growing to such an impressive size that no well-stocked library is sufficiently large and no long-forgotten archive secret enough to be able to hide it. Yet, they remain unseen. Buried under countless tomes and covered by a myriad of scrolls, the book wyrm slumbers. Undetected, it raises its brood of living sheets to flood each and every corner where paper is made, read, written on, stored or gathers dust. It isn’t a hostile creature and in no way easily disturbed. However, threatening its kin – deliberately or not – easily wakes not only the book wyrm itself but with it its wrath…

Found in the [[The Planar Archives]], when a patron harms their defenseless, younger kin.
