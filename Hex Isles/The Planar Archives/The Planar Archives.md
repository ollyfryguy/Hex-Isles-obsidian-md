The Planar Archives is an ever-expanding archive, whose purpose is to store the texts and writings, however new or ancient, from across the planes. It works on a system of [[Honor]], where a higher honor results in more access to the archive. 

Planar Traits:
- Physical Traits:
	- Flowing Time. On some planes, time can flow faster or slower. One may travel to another plane, spend a year there, then return to the Material Plane to find that only six seconds have elapsed. Everything on the plane returned to is only a few seconds old. But for that traveler and the items, spells, and effects working on them, that year away was entirely real.
		- Erratic Time. Some planes have time that slows down and speeds up, so an individual may lose or gain time as he moves between the two planes. The following table is used to determine how long time spent in the archive is relative to the material plane.
		- 0-33: Act as if plane is *Timeless*
		- 34-66: 2 to 1 correspondence (ex: 2 minute archive = 1 minute material plane)
		- 67-99: Same as material plane
		- 100: 1 to 10 correspondence (1 minute archive = 10 minute material plane)
	- Self-Contained Shape. The archive is "practically infinite" in that its ever-expanding through the continued use of the [[Co-Creator]]. However, should a creature reach the "edge" of this flat plane, it looks like a complete wall of dark. Walking through this wall teleports someone to the center.
	- Non-Euclidean Geometry. The archive does not follow standard euclidean geometry; things normally impossible (Moving in a circle despite going only straight, two creatures becoming split despite following the same path, etc.) may occur.
- Morphic Traits:
	- Alterable Morphic. (Same as material plane)
- Alignment Traits:
	- Law-Aligned - Mild.
		- Creatures who have an alignment opposite that of a mildly alligned plane (so people of a chaotic alignment) take a -2 circumstance penalty on all Charisma-based checks.
- Magic Traits:
	- Limited Magic. Spells of the schools or criteria below dont work.
		- Enchantment Spells (Charm and Compulsion spells; mind-affecting spells.)
		- Spells done with the intent to harm.
