Evera is pronounced "Uh-ver-uh"

Prior Leader and Head Archivist of [[The Planar Archives]].
Heavily Influenced by [[The Eye]], trying to fight against it.

History:
The Archive was going to be destroyed. [[The Forum]] were close to succeeding and Evera knew. Saw. She studied, poured herself into every facet of knowledge she had available. And yet it was futile. Evera would have to sit by and *[[The Eye|watch]]* as her life's work burned [just like its ancestors.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria) Well, there was one hope. See, [[Hex Isles Barrier|Hex Isle's Barrier]] did not interfere with psionics as much as it did arcane or divine magic. It still... tampered with it to a certain degree. Most people who tried using it as a desperate escape went either insane or died to a mental shock mere moments after. But, *technically*, it was possible. So, Evera did the only thing she could. Using some magic items (primarily Eyes of Power Leech), along with draining some of The Archive's power, she entered the Astral Plane and traveled outside of Hex Isle's reach and into a willing vessel. That vessel came to be known as **Sparrow Goldwater**. She then attempted to stop [[The Forum]], and was partially successful, saving The Archive's from imminent destruction.

While she was gone, [[Vix Leitner]] struck a deal with the new acting leader, [[I need to make this dude]]. In exchange for shipments of books from outside the barrier, Vix would be granted a high honor of 70. However, this brought [[The Eye]]s influence closer, and with a much greater force than previously. The only reason The Archive had yet to be under it's influence is due to its distance from the material plane. The Eye would, for lack of a better explanation, have to extend its tendrils of power through the gateways into The Archive, weakening it considerably. Even with this protection, Evera was still much influenced by it, though she has continued trying to fight back. But now, with Vix involved, a true avatar of it, [[The Planar Archives]] fell into [[The Eye]]'s jurisdiction.

[[Vix Leitner]], knowing Evera would be problematic in keeping her control over the archive, has intentionally kept her body in status. Evera will most likely be willing to aid the party in retrieving the [[Co-Creator]].
