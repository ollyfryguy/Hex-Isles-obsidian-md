Name:
Able to Use Magic: Yes
If Answer is Yes, How? Innate + Divine Spellcasting
Additional Features: **Divine Rank 0**
Short Description:

Notes: All spells, regardless of origin or somatic components, seem to be replaced with fire. It is in contact with multiple high ranking gods, all revolving in some way with fire. It has shown features and traits usually reserved for higher, divine beings and has been given a cautionary **Rank 0** divine rank.

It was sent to Hex Isles due to 3 counts of Arson, the last count resulting in the death of civilians "Martin Blackwood", "Adam Key", and "Hope Panshea". It pleaded Not Guilty in court before being sentenced to death after a 7 hour period of decision making by the jury.

Addendum 1:
Approximately 6 months after initial entrapment within Hex Isles, Blaze suddenly disappeared from available means of observation. (Rest is locked behind [[Honor]] requirement 40): 1 month after, it was spotted again in [[Sector H, The Wickermen]]. Noticeably different in behavior than initial entrance. Possession or otherwise hostile action from followers of [[The Desolation]] is presumed. For all intents and purposes, Blaze is currently considered an avatar of it.
