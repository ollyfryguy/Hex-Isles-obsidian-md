Honor is a system used by [[The Planar Archives]] in regards to which books are accesible. A person with high honor can access more books than one who does not.  Doing good things for the archives boosts your honor, while doing things looked down upon can decrease it. It works with a 0 to 100 scale.

Honor was not actually created by [[The Head Archivist - Evera Stall - Sparrow Goldwater|Evera]], nor any other member of The Archives. Rather, the system of Honor is a direct side effect of The Archive's sentience, which was then discovered, quantified, and developed by Evera when she first discovered The Archive.

0-4 Honor: Guest
5-10 Honor: Member. Gets access to a gate to The Planar Archives, along with a sapphire pendant, which halts most of the non-Euclidean geometry from affecting them.

List of Individuals which have Honor higher than 0, highest to lowest:
[[The Head Archivist - Evera Stall - Sparrow Goldwater]] - 93
[[That one acting leader I havent made yet]] - 81
[[Vix Leitner]] - 70
[[Nothzarai Yull]] - 30
[[Elizabeth Dun]] - 25
