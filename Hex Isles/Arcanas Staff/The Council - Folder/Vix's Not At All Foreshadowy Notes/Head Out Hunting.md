*As your walking with the others, this letter appears in one of your free hands; so subtly you don't even realize your holding something for a good minute.*

Morning, [[V-1|V-1]]. Hope your escapades have been going swimmingly thus far. I couldnt help but notice that you and your little adventuring partners are heading for [[The Ancients]] next. If I may offer some advice with my experience? Choose your words carefully. Anyway, not what I'm actually sending this letter for. Now that you've become acquaintances with [[Sector E, Village of Mercenaries|those mercenaries]], I *highly* advise going on a hunting mission today, and the following days. An hour should suffice. I... suppose I cant tell you much. Call it a hunch? "Magic stuff" will probably happen if you dont. Have a good rest of your day, V-1. Be seeing you.

As sincerely as ever, [[Vix Leitner]].




























The **Pre-Arranged Abscence Form** is so that the coaches know what days you'll me missing Robotics, as we are getting close to competition. As such, **you put every day you know you will be missing robotics on the paper.** 

Okay, so if the pre-arranged abscence form is to tell *the teachers* when we will be gone due to robotics, why are you putting things unrelated to robotics on the paper, and why are you not putting in our event dates? Its either put the event dates if this paragraph is true, or do the paragraph above if the paragraph above is true.
