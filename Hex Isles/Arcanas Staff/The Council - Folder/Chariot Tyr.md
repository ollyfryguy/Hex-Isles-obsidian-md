Player Notes Ver: [[Chariot Tyr (Player Notes)]]

6th Member of The Council
Pronouns: They/She
Description: Their attire is a mishmash of bright colors and eye catching outfits. 5'10. They usually wear a black bowler hat with a dark purple fur coat, high leather boots, and black stockings. They have a feather of an unknown creature on their hat. (Nature Check with DC 15 reveals this feather to be from a Griffen.)

Roleplay:
Generally flamboyant, eccentric. Unformal. Talks casually with citizens and the party despite status. Confident

RP Notes:
Their attire and personality is in direct opposition to their position and fear: [[The Lonely]]. This is because they are the most recent indoctrination and are still partially fighting against it's control. When alone with the party they might try and signal them that something is wrong, though is unable to say directly.
