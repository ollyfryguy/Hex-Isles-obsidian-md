[[General History - The Council]]
Each Council Member is an Avatar to one of the [[Great Fears]].  

~~[[The Council]] is the direct governing authority of [[Arcanas Staff]]. Arcana's Staff works on an oligarchical system; each council member is elected through a vote by the masses, and then each council member votes individually on policies, laws, regulations, etc. A majority vote (51%) is required to pass most things. For things that could cause a great effect, a two thirds majority is required.~~
