"Gods are the recognized higher beings. Ignoring the Primordials and Old Gods, whose creation remains unknown, most gods are created through the belief of intelligent creatures. If enough creatures of strong belief believe a god to exist, then it does. This book will not be talking about these more known types of Gods, but rather focusing on a type this author recently hypothesized to exist, hereby referred to as Great Fears." -The Archivist, date redacted.

The Great Fears are a subset of gods, most* created by the time the first intelligent creatures evolved. These Great Fears, despite common perception, do *not* simply feed off fear but are fears made manifest. It is not only human fear that counts, but that of animals as well, particularly for [[The Flesh]] and [[The Hunt]]. The more fearful the material plane is of a certain thing, the more powerful the related entity becomes, becoming empowered by the increased fear of its realm. 

Their influence upon reality manifests as supernatural happenings – things that fail to have physical, logical, magical, and/or divine reasonings; all supernatural phenomena in the world are simply extensions of them. These phenomena can take various forms such as people, animals, monsters, books, objects, or places, all with the goal of evoking fear, terror, and paranoia from all who encounter them.

Their goal is to grow stronger, which means to increase the fear of the material plane.

Most of their avatars are former [[The Council|council]] members.
