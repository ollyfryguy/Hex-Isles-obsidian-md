[[Arcanas Staff]], roughly 3 years ago, split. Since all members had differing views, while helpful to keep policies fair, made tension high between them. [[Liam Osworth]] (Avatar of [[The Hunt]]) was the first to secede from [[The Council]] and the rest quickly followed suit. Now, [[Arcanas Staff]] is mow split into 9 [[Sectors (Arcanas Staff)|sectors]].

Each sector is cut off from one another through 5 meters of coarse dirt. [[Sector E, Village of Mercenaries]] does not have this dividing line, as it does not consider itself part of [[Arcanas Staff]] no longer.

[[Sector A, Drop Off Point|Sector A, "Drop Off Point"]]. Controlled by [[Chariot Tyr]] and [[The Lonely]]. Since she is still fighting against [[The Lonely]], they wanted to be the main access point for new people from [[Khortan]]. 

[[Sector B, Distortion Palace]], Controlled by [[Dain Aetos]] and [[The Spiral]]. 

[[Sector C, Crawlers]], Controlled by [[Haspoth Tec]], the Avatar of [[The Corruption]].

[[Sector D, Diviners]], Controlled by [[Vix Leitner]], former [[The Council|council]] member and Avatar of [[The Eye]]. Contains the head building of [[TAPA]].

[[Sector E, Village of Mercenaries]], Controlled by [[Liam Osworth]], former [[The Council|council]] member and Avatar of [[The Hunt]].

[[Sector F, The Falling City]], Controlled by [[Poskol Morr]], Avatar of [[The Vast]].

[[Sector G, The Staff's Auditorium]], Controlled by [[Roskinov Entreal]], Avatar of [[The Stranger]].

[[Sector H, The Wickermen]], Controlled by [[Tairn Dai]], Avatar of [[The Desolation]]
