Player Notes Ver: [[Sector D, Diviners]]

Description:
Large, wooden structures, built and carved with immaculate detail and care, no filth you guys can see, not many people out on the streets and those that are seem to be walking with a purpose. A grand building in the center, maybe 4 to 5 stories tall, is the cities' library. Small, carved in sigils in the sides of buildings or floor seem to glow a light green as you walk by.
