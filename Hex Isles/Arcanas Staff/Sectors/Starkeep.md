Prior Capital of [[Arcanas Staff]]. Located near the entrance of [[Hex Isles Barrier]] and served as the primary dumping grounds for new inmates, prior to the laws repeal. Now after [[The Council]] broke apart and split into [[Sectors (Arcanas Staff)|sectors]], its still a large city, but now only the capital (and only) city of [[Sector A, Drop Off Point]], controlled by [[Chariot Tyr]].

**Climate and Geography**:
Small beach/sandy area near the "dumping grounds". Most of the area is sparse, temperate woodlands, with small patches of hills.

Organizations:
Head Building of the [[Arcane Fire Service|ARS]] is located near the towns center. Only station currently populated by firefighters (instead of [[Arcane Fire Service|Firebugs]]).
