Controlled by [[Dain Aetos]], former [[The Council|council]] member and Avatar of [[The Spiral]]. Part of [[Arcanas Staff|Arcana's Staff]].
Player Notes Ver: [[Sector B, Distortion Palace (Player Notes)]]

Description:
The air periodically shifts and wobbles like looking over the top of a fire, despite no heat change. Forks in the road start and lead to dead ends, the paths loop back onto themselves, and its generally a mess to navigate. After trying to find the head building for 10 or so minutes, [[Dain Aetos]] will talk behind them, saying: "And I take it these are our new guests?" (Ignore that it says Liam Osworth.)

Note. While no people are present the first time the party sets foot, the next the town will be bustling, and the next only a few people, etc, etc. This place is controlled by [[The Spiral]], which operates in this case on confusion and deception. This is different from the later point of [[Sector A, Drop Off Point]], when there are no people, as thats controlled by [[The Lonely]].
