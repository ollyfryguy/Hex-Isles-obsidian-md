The Arcane Fire Service, usually just referred to as the Fire Service, is the sole preventor and stopper of fires within [[Arcanas Staff|Arcana's Staff]]. Using a (mostly) automated process of detecting fires and extinguishing them.

Independent organization, serves to all [[Sectors (Arcanas Staff)|sectors]], apart from [[Sector E, Village of Mercenaries]] and [[Sector H, The Wickermen]] who keep destroying the firebugs. Head building in

Fire Removal Process:
Using personalized expeditious messengers (homunculi from the Eberron Campaign Setting, pg 285, [link](https://www.arkalseif.info/monsters/eberron-campaign-setting--12/expeditious-messenger--38/index.html)), referred to by townsfolk as Firebugs, equipped with a wand of [quench](https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/quench.htm) and [detect fire](https://dnd.arkalseif.info/spells/frostburn--68/detect-fire--1265/index.html), they constantly fly around Arcana Staff's cities and towns. Due to a expeditious messenger's only semi low intelligence (8, aka -1), they can almost always figure out if a fire is a problem and swiftly take care of it. If they are unable to identify a fire as being fine or grounds for removal, they will message a mental image to the nearest fire service, where a operator will tell them what to do.

Consequences of this approach:
The actual firefighters of the AFS is always slim in numbers. Since the automated (~) system gets rid of almost all fires, the 1% it doesnt (either due to intentional arson with the destruction of the Firebugs or mass arcane/divine fire spread) usually spreads out of control. Since the firefighters are always low on staff, it takes a lot more time to get ready and move down to the fire to put it out. Seeing firefighters out on duty (not Firebugs) is considered a bad omen by the townsfolk for this reason.
