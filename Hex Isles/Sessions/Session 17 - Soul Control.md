#Architects 

After travelling through [[The Architects]] for a bit, they find one of the Winged Scouts, who questions them as to their presence in their territory.

	For the Winged Scout Statblock, use a Toliforged Sentinel, with the following changes:

	Once at 65 HP, gains Enfeebled 2. Fort Save for Tigoon (DC 15) or be blinded for a round. Otherwise, simply be dazzled.

	Exertion Aura is replaced by Fear Aura. Same DC Will Save or become Frightened 1 (Frightened 2 on a critical failure). This fear ends as soon as the creature remains outside of the aura for 1 minute.

Due to their low intelligence, if it deems the party a threat or if they attack first, it'll attack.
