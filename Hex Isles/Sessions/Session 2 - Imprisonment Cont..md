*Last time on Hex Isles:* You all awoke on a small, wooden rowboat. Two guards, a stern Kitsune and a rather meek Leshy, stood and watched you. As they were about to go about their speech, one of your shipmates, a rather young looking Kobold, closed his eyes as his skin quickly morphed and transformed into that of a medium size dragon. It was quickly subdued by the ship's runes, new cuffs were placed onto it, and some small talk proceeded between the Kitsune and Tanuki of the party.

At the start of the session, Ill have all players introduce themselves and their characters. Afterwards, the Kitsune glances over to the Leshy and nods. The Leshy speaks up in a rather timid but firm voice. (Lets see if the players will let me info spill without one of them setting the damn boat on fire).

"Right, uh, evening everyone. It seems your anesthetics have mostly worn off now, so if youll let me quickly talk about your guy's circumstances that'd be great. ...Right, so, in case you somehow didnt know, you are currently on a boat to Hex Isles. I, uh, dont know what you all did to get here, they dont give me that kind of information, but you were all sentenced to death row, before being sent here instead. Incase middle school history didnt cover it, back a hundred years ago or so there was a group known as The Starred Collective. They were a group of powerful magic users and researchers. I wont go too much in depth since its not important, but one of them died on this island we're going to. Their magic, due to its quantity, shockwaved out from the islands center and made a veil around the island. Once you enter, its virtually impossible to exit.  Um... any questions?"

Upon answering any potential questions, the leshy looks back to the kitsune, who tells everyone that they have around 10 minutes until they reach the island, and to feel free to converse among yourselves.

After some time to let them all get to know each other and converse, Hex Isles comes into view. The island's barrier is the first thing you notice, semi-transparent and stretching up nearly 4, 500 meters high. It has a blueish green tint, which seems to scatter and move across it's surface. There is a large city on the other side of the veil, with 10, 20 bystanders stopping by and watching you guys with curious eyes. You notice you cant hear anything from the other side of the veil. The boat slowly comes to a stop at a wooden dock, and the Kitsune says "We'd rather not have to push you guys in."

The barrier ripples like throwing a stone into water as they pass through. 

Once you've all entered a large crowd has gathered round. Seems like they don't get very many people coming here. After a couple moments a booming voice cuts through the crowd as they all grow silent.

This voice is [[Chariot Tyr]]
"Now, now, give the newcomers some space, wont you? Wouldnt want to startle them away!"

The crowd makes room and Chariot greets the party, telling them where they are. She asks them to follow her to somewhere more private, where she explains whats happening.

Roughly explain each core faction ([[Arcanas Staff]], [[The Architects]], [[The Ancients]], and [[The Planar Archives]].)

They are to go and meet with each groups leaders, before, in a week, meeting up with all the factions and choosing where they want to stay. You'll know the location when it nears the end of the due date.
