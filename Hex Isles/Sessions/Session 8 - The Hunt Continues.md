Initiative Order for Hunt:
Cyn is 12, V-1 is 26, Akane is nat 20, Cash is 17. Dashel: 21, Hunters is 12.;

When everyone is done with the hunt and has said their goodbyes, Poskol greets them where they left them at, slightly worried for their condition. They say the party should stay at an Inn

~~Tigoons mother was teleported here after an encounter with a strong wizard or some shit.~~



Homebrew: When V-1 is *raging*, the effects of the [[The Hunt]] happen. Corruption and positive effects do not take place when V-1 is not raging, and nothing can happen regarding [[The Hunt]] happens when V-1 is not raging, though other avatars of [[Great Fears|The Fears]] can tell the Prescence of a hunter when with or close to V-1. See specific effects in [[V-1]]
