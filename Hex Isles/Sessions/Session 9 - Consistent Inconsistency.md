Next Up, [[The Ancients]].

"Then its decided! Due to the... conditions of [[The Ancients]] territory, I will be replacing one of my guards with a guide and translator. They have free reign to talk more freely about them, once you guys are out of my territory."

"After 10 or so minutes, what you presume to be your guide rushes over from one of the nearby streets with a smile. [[Espes|read their description]] "Hi Chariot! You called? Oh, these must be the newcomers right? Oh, its just lovely to meet y'all— I'm [[Espes]], though I assume you can read the name tag. Ill be your guyses guide to [[The Ancients]]. " || 

As the party is about to go out, make sure you know who's leading and write it here ---------

Read this line and give [[V-1|Damien]] [[Head Out Hunting|the note]]. Make no comment regarding it, and dont mention it. "Alright, so you guys follow a dirt road out of [[Sector A, Drop Off Point|The Drop Off Point]] and off to [[The Ancients]]. The paths clearly well traveled, and you guys see some dense forest ahead, along with a small mountain range the path seems to cut through. Espes speaks up and goes "The Ancients territory is around 8, 10 miles from here, so if we keep time we'll probably get there in 2-3 hours. Oh, and keep your guard up— while all main factions have agreed not to attack you newcomers, some of the smaller ones or people not apart of a faction havent. Hell, they might target y'all because of that, I dunno."

After an hour or so. they make it to the forested section described earlier. I roll Hide for all of the creatures (see below) and roll a secret perception check for the leader of the party.

DC (5): "In a small clearing slash widening of the path, you see a obvious trap in the middle of the road. A net, with loose leaves kind of covering it, but not very well, along with a not so subtle rope attached to it, trailing to a nearby tree."

If the perception check is higher than the hide check for the enemies, then describe that as well in the above text.

The net is a decoy. The enemies, assuming no one can see them, wait to attack the party should they go around the net. If the party waits or looks for potential people who could activate/benefit from the map, they simply attack. In the first case, all PCs get the Off-Guard condition for the starting round of combat.

Head to [Pathfinder Dashboard](https://pathfinderdashboard.com/#!) and go to the top right. They'll be an option to import encounters, put this file in.

"The human, or what's left of them, is almost entirely covered in plants. Vines are wrapped around their body, arms, and legs, their eyes are covered by sprouting flowers, and their fingers are entirely thorn as they shamble towards you."

When they kill everyone, if they decide to loot the bodies, they find in the pocket of the former guard a small, crumpled up note. Its written in common, though it seems to be in complete gibberish. There's also a small stamp at the bottom of a orange sun. (The [[Summer (Faction)|Summer's]] stamp of verification).

The rest of the walk there goes uneventfully.
