#Planar_Archives 

Party after going through the Ancients goes to [[The Planar Archives]] next. 

Session starts with [[Akane]]'s perspective. Essentially getting dragged into the main hall / waiting room of the archive, before a paper note appeared on her lap to "please wait." She did so, and a couple hours later the rest of the party arrived. [[Nothzarai Yull]] greets them (and from [[Akane]]'s perspective its clear that he teleported in right as they arrived), before they show the party around the archive.

"Our current leader is currently unavailable, but I'm of high enough [[Honor]] that I can probably show you around and call it good." (Paraphrased)

They show off the [[Co-Creator]], and then allow the party to browse for the rest of their stay.

[[V-1|V-2]] gets some books on general magic and arcane theory.

[[Sandalphon]] acquires some books of his [[Sandalphons Cult|cult]].

Can't remember what Akane got

Can't remember what Cyn got

[[Tigoon]] got files on all party members, apart from himself. This included:
 - [[Blaze - File|Blaze]]
 - [[Espes]]
 - Noah's Past Character
 - [[Chariot Tyr]]
 - Cyn
 - Akane
 - Foogoo (Fugu?) (his slime)
 - [[V-1|V-1]]
 - [[Sandalphon]]

Relevant information uncovered about each of them includes:
- Blaze:
	 - See [[Blaze - File]].
- Espes:
	 - General informtation, address
- Noah's Past Character
	- "After losing their status as a watched individual, they were killed by [[Vix Leitner]] from a sudden and total drainage of all magic, leaving a lifeless husk. "
- [[Chariot Tyr]]
	- Feather on hat is from a griffin.
	- (Locked behind [[Honor]] requirement 40): Begrudging avatar of [[The Lonely]]. Is still attempting to fight against it. Physical State weakening due to that.
- Cyn
	- Just general information. Robotic service droid which acted as a maid in a manor of an unknown individual, which served also served as the church to an unknown god. After comitting various acts of crime for favor of this God, such as a double homicide and larceny, was sent to Hex Isles.
- Akane
	- Learned that she is a fey.
	- (Locked behind [[Honor]] requirement 20): Potential physical and social integration into [[Fae Folk]] society is to be expected if she stays for a prolonged time in [[The Ancients]] territory.
- Foogoo
	- An ink black, slime-like creature, bonded to watched individual "[[Tigoon]]". Acts as a familiar, despite no magic connection between it and Tigoon.
	- (Locked behind [[Honor]] requirement 15): The substance Foogoo is made out of seems to be inherently chaotic. When substance is taken away from Foogoo and injected / coated onto other objects, target object's properties are seemingly randomized. This property has caused the "magical" properties of the mallet [[Tigoon]] holds.
	- (Locked behind [[Honor]] requirement 40): More information could not be found on Foogoo's origins, despite attempts to [[The Eye|behold it divinely.]]
- [[V-1|V-1]]
	- General information. Body is controlled by two souls, one only in control when in combat.
	- (Locked behind [[Honor]] requirement 40): After visiting [[Sector E, Village of Mercenaries]], V-1 seems marked with [[The Hunt]]. [[Vix Leitner]] is currently trying to spur on its influence. Inside of [[The Ancients]], [[V-1s First Hunting Session|a ritual to it was performed]], marking V-1's entry. V-2 does not seem to hold the same influence.
- [[Sandalphon]]
	- Basic information, basic information about cult.
	- (Locked behind [[Honor]] 20): See origin in Sandalphon's note.
