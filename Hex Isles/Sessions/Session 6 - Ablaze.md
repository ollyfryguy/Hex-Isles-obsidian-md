Massive curtains envelop the audience, separating the stands from the rest of the party. 2 people come out in standard medical uniform, carrying out the Janni on a stretcher. [[Roskinov Entreal]] teleports down (magically), thanking them for their fabulous show. As he's speaking he gets cut off by a scroll appearing in his hands. They quickly read it, before it crumbles to ash. "Unfortunate; was starting to like him." The party sees as our other robotic friend's life leaves his eyes abruptly, as he collapses to the ground. Tigoon, please meet with me outside.

Just for Tigoon: All creatures have magic in them, with spellcasters being able to harness that magic to cast. When he drops dead, you see that magic disappear, like it was being drained out of him until nothing else remains. 

V-1 Please meet me outside. Just for V-1: You see, or more so sense, the book you had on you, that Vix gave you with the Amber sigil; that sigil starts glowing as this happens and stops when he fully collapses.

After all of that, [[Roskinov Entreal]] only seems mildly disappointed. "I do apologize for your loss, but the show must continue regardless. Only one more sector to go, afterall. Oh, and that reminds me! Here, for your wonderful performance. Even if you choose not to join us, take it as a symbol of gratitude, for you will always be welcome in my territory."

Each player adds a [Persona Mask](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=3099&Redirected=1) to their inventory.

Roskinov takes his lead, saying he has a meeting to attend to with "[[Monasteel Kacee|Monasteel]]."

As Tigoon approaches [[Sector H, The Wickermen|Sector H]], he sees light magic in the air on the Sector's side of the border. (Illusion magic to hide the fire and damage).

As the party approaches [[Sector H, The Wickermen|Sector H]], they notice a bot just inside the territory; it looks like a rudimentary construct, more specifically a homunculus; whoever is leading the group tells me their perception and I make a secret roll with DC: 13. If they pass, they see a damaged emblem/badge on its shoulder which reads "AFS: Arcane Fire Service". Everyone above a craft modifier of +5 rolls, with a DC of 15. If they pass, they realize the bot is heavily burnt, but not only burnt, *melted*. Whatever did these damages it was intentional unless the bot literally ran head first into lava.

Once they enter the territory's bounds, everything around them changes dramatically. The air turns a shade of orange, very similar if not the same as Wildfire haze. Billowing smoke is rising from the center of town. Ask if anyone here actively worships a god. If they do, they recognize a weak divine presence in this sector, though it seems wrong in some way.
