#Ancients 
**[[Tarot Cards]] For The Day:**
	The Moon: Symbolizes confusion, fear, misinterpretation.
	The Tower: Symbolizes disaster, sudden upheaval, sudden change, 

Session Start:
"Now, before we get into our show spectators, I will, of course, be meeting one on one with our contestants, give them the private rundown. We'll be back in 5!"

*The lights cut to black, and the room is dark to the point of being unable to see anything. Even if you have dark vision. Except for Tigoon, who sees a soft glow all around them, as you all are surrounded in magical darkness. And then [[Elizabeth]] appears in front of you all, holding a small sphere of light; just the basic light spell.*

(Beat)

"Why are you here." *Voice cold, referring to [[Tigoon]].* Now improv.
(Mention how the one who pushed her in is called "Preox", and how the longer a person interacts with the folk, the more folk like they become. Also, have Elizabeth and [[Espes]] chat for a little bit. [[Elizabeth]] and Espes are acquantinces, as she led her through [[The Ancients]] for a little and made sure she didnt immediately die.)

"I... dont know if I can protect you here. Stay safe, dont screw around too much. And... good luck, Tigoon."

*[[Elizabeth]] teleports away, the magical darkness lifts, and the stage lights blare on again.*

"And we're back folk! Sorry for the delay, but we'll be going right into todays games. First off, some basic combat to get everyones blood pumping! Or, well, for those of us that have it."

*The column that the party is on, is suddenly dropped, along with the 2 other parties there.*

"And of course, with the spirit of these games, they'll be a little twist to start us off."

*The entire battlefield is covered in mist. Unless a character trait says otherwise, everyones vision is limited to 2 squares of themselves. Everyone makes will save, DC 15. On a fail, they're teleported to a random place on the map. **To set this up, Label the edges of the map as grid coordinates (x = A, B, C, D, etc; y = 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.). On the notes of your initiative tracker, add the space they are in.***

8 Teams did remain: 4 teams do now. Second round - Dodgestone.

Players will either be healed back to full or for 2d8 depending on how dead they are. The game will be explained by [[Elizabeth]] and they will have 10 minutes to decide what they want on their field. Walls, elevation, certain features, etcetera. Walls, stairs, slopes, etc cost 1 per square; traps are equal to their levelx10 in cost and take up their squares listed. Nontraps but special features (brambles, trees, lights, etc.) cost 2 per square. They have 100 points to work with.

"Dodgestone". The Idea is simple; Remaining contestants are placed into equal teams, and a line of enchanted stones is placed in the middle of the arena. Contestants are allowed to cross onto the opponents side, and the stones are enchanted with various effects, though indistinguishable from one another.

1d4 is rolled when a stone is picked up to determine the effects it has:
1. ["Wildmagic"](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1580) activates upon successful hit.
2. When thrown, acts as the spell "[Hurtling Stone](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1798)"
3. On hit, acts as the spell "[Drain Life](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=2118)"
4. When thrown, [slashing gust](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1321) to two nearest enemy creatures during projectile.
5. Grabber glows as the light spell (bright light for 30ft, dim light for another 30)
6. Grabber must succeed on a DC 20 will save or be teleported to a random place on their field (either side).
7. Its just a normal rock.
8. Random attempt of [telekinetic manuever](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1717) is used on creature hit, using grabber's skills when necessary.
9. Whoever is actively holding the stone gains Clumsy 1
10. This stone grows in size as you hold it: Athletics 15 to not drop it, deals 3d6+5

In addition to the above effect, the stone does 1d6+1+str damage.

The famished mimic is the star, and is apperaing as a pile of spell rocks.

Each wall is 14 Hardness, 56 HP, Broken Threshold
Wall Damaged 1, 53 HP.

The Roof is at 54 HP.

For their side: Blue is walls
