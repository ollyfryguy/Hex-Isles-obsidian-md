**Presession**:
Talk with Damien about respecing his character so that he has more fun playing [[V-1]]. Give him the following classes to slowly change to:
 - Magus
 - Witch
 - Oracle

The class he specs into chooses his fate.
- ~~**For Magus:** [[Tigoon]]'s ability to cause [[Abstraction]], due to him not understanding his powers fully, can happen on accident. Especially when Titan is in control. During the chaos of the fight, that abstraction caused the magic contained within Mari's ([[V-1|V-2]]'s) soul to manifest, changing [[V-1|V-2]]'s internal systems to account for the mana loss. [[V-1|V-2]] resets after the scorching ray, and finds herself in the [[Narrative Space]]. She sees the outline of herself, along with her soul. A blue orb (no red orb). Which then shifts to a vibrant purple. The strings connecting [[V-1|V-2]] and her gauntlets suddenly turn black before snapping and disintegrating, before [[V-1|V-2]] wakes up.~~
- ~~**For Sorcerer:** [[Vix Leitner]] visits [[Sector G, The Staff's Auditorium]] and talks to [[Roskinov Entreal]], trying to say that the situation has changed drastically, "The hunter's gone.", and to, one, recruit [[V-1|V-2]] to the eye's jurisdiction, and two, explain what the necessary information regarding [[Great Fears|The Fears]]. Roskinov rejects this, saying [[V-1|V-2]] is now under *his* jurisdiction, and to, politely, back the hell off. After a little bit of back and forth, **[[Vix Leitner]]** finally agrees under the condition that [[Roskinov Entreal]] keeps his corruption level and influence down.~~
- **For Oracle**:  [[Vix Leitner]] visits [[Sector G, The Staff's Auditorium]] and talks to [[Roskinov Entreal]], trying to say that the situation has changed drastically, "The hunter's gone.", and to, one, recruit [[V-1|V-2]] to the eye's jurisdiction, and two, explain what the necessary information regarding [[Great Fears|The Fears]].  Roskinov rejects this, saying [[V-1|V-2]] is now under *his* jurisdiction, and to, politely, back the hell off. After a little bit of back and forth, **[[Roskinov Entreal]]** finally agrees under the condition that [[Vix Leitner]] tells him exactly what's going on with the party.

Session starts with [[Tigoon]]'s POV as he exits his tent. He finds himself in the [[Sky Islands]].

**Description:**
	"The first thing you notice is that the are seems set in permanent fall. The leaves on the various trees are amber and gold, and most of the general architecture is set in those kinda brown, earthy tones. Its not overly aggressive, but its certainly noticeable. Overall, It kinda feels like how [[Sector A, Drop Off Point|the Drop Off Point]] feels, but there's a lot less hustle and bustle. Calmer."

[[Monasteel Kacee|Kacee]] shows him around, letting him get acquainted, and temporary housing, and all of that.  After a few hours, a scroll appears in [[Tigoon]]'s hands.

Next it cuts to [[V-1|V-2]], inside of [[Sector G, The Staff's Auditorium]]. If Damien chose a class respec option before this, see that part for what happens. Otherwise, [[Roskinov Entreal|Roskinov]] shows [[V-1|V-2]] around, getting her acquainted. And after a few hours of touring the city, a scroll appears in her hands.

Cut to [[Cyn]] and [[Akane]], over in [[The Architects]]. [[Anyx]] gets them acquainted, saying they can crass at his and [[Trash Hunter]]'s place till they can manage on their own. Also says he can craft them their first [[Augments]]. Something simple to get their body's used to it.
	"I still remember the first one I got. Was something basic--just a tracker to my shop so I knew where it was when I was gatherin' materials. Before [[Trash Hunter]] came along, that is. It takes some gettin' used to, thats for sure.". After a few hours, showing them how to navigate the layers more effectively, a scroll appears in [[Akane]] and [[Cyn]]'s hands.

Cut finally to [[Sandalphon]]. [[Aster]] appears with the sound of wind chimes as some of the flowers in the field bloom. They thank [[Sandalphon]] for the lovely performances so far, and ask (to the best of their ability) if the divination method is serving them well.

After a bit of small talk, they suggest an idea. 

[[Sandalphon]] could become a [[Fae Folk|Folk]].

They could help their party indirectly, and not be bound by some of those limitations of the flesh.
