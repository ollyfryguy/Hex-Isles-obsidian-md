General Session Outline:
[[Anyx]] (and [[Trash Hunter]] the best he can) tries to help [[Tigoon]] find more information about what is currently happening to him. After looking through his small personal library, he find's a... kind of related book? Regarding the [[Weavers]] ritual practices and general beliefs.

Midway through explanation notices [[Foogoo]] and asks what the heck it is.

[[Anyx]] comments on [[The Architects]] being the last stop for the party, and suggests taking a break before going to the [[Choosing Ceremony]]. [[Trash Hunter]] excitedly suggests a tour of [[The Architects]].
