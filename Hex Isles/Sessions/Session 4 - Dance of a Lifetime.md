[[Poskol Morr|Poskol]] offers them an overnight stay. As each person wakes up, they see a small, neatly folded letter, addressed to their characters from [[Vix Leitner|Vix]].

"Morning, [Character Name]. Just wanted to congratulate you all on making it through your first real day of the island. You'll be heading to [[Sector G, The Staff's Auditorium]] today, so I'd just like to warn you that they tend to be... eccentric, I suppose. I'd recommend sharpening your weapons."

Regarding specific people:
Tigoon: The envelopes give off a slight magic glow, quickly fading as you see and pick them up. They were probably teleported in as soon or near as soon as you woke up.

V-1: "P.S, I've attached a small book on arcane principles. I think you'll find it rather helpful." - You can see one of those small, amber sigils on the back, the ones you saw a lot of in Sector D, again glowing a soft green.

Poskol will offer a lift to the edge between [[Sector F, The Falling City|his sector]] and [[Sector G, The Staff's Auditorium]], the party's next stop. Once they step inside, switch to that note.
