The session begins with the player's waking up from their anesthetics. They're on a small wooden rowboat, paddling through a seemingly endless expanse of sea. All player's where anesthetics would not effect them are instead chained to a pole in the center.

The players are dropped off at [[Chariot Tyr]]'s [[Sectors (Arcanas Staff)|Sector]]
