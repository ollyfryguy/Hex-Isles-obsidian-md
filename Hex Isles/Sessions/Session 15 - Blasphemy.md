9/3/25

[[Elizabeth]] is memory wiped of the party after upsetting the High Folk in control of the death game. Party otherwise leaves in one piece. After getting back to [[Arcanas Staff]], they go for a shopping session with the gold they acquired, and choose to go to [[The Planar Archives]] next.

After [[Sandalphon]] harasses some [[TAPA]] employees while searching for the newspaper boy, they arrive at [[Sector D, Diviners|Diviner's]] library. [[Vix Leitner]] greets them, expecting their arrival ([[The Eye|obviously]]) and shows them the way into the archives. They open a seemingly random book, and instead of the author's name, the symbol of [[The Planar Archives]] is shown. They then tell the party to trace two fingers over the symbol, before they're teleported off. Session ends there.
