General Session Outline:
After a drink and needed decompressing period at [[Moment's Respite]], the party gets ready to head to the [[Choosing Ceremony]], hosted in a pocket dimension, the access of which is only told via sending scroll to the necessary individuals.

After they rest and awake the next day, they find on their bedside the sending scroll, written by [[Vix Leitner]], detailing the specific spot they should go to, along with [[Newcomer Pendant|a pendant]] marking them as the newcomers.
