Main article: [[Sector B, Distortion Palace]]

Controlled by [[Dain Aetos]]

Description: The air periodically shifts and wobbles like looking over the top of a fire, despite no heat change. Forks in the road start and lead to dead ends, the paths loop back onto themselves, and its generally a mess to navigate.

Additional Notes: 
Surprisingly good food. 
**No people in sight.**
We already said it but what the hell is this layout.
