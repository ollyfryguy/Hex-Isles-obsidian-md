Main Article: [[Sector C, Crawlers]]

Controlled by [[Haspoth Tec]].

Description: *Very* dirty. Stinks; smells of trash and disease. Infested; you can see small bugs roaming the place. People in tattered clothes wandering around. **They don't seem to mind.**

Additional Notes:
Apparently a industrial sector, though you wouldn't be able to tell.
