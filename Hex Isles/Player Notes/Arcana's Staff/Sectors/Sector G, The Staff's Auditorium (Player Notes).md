Main Article: [[Sector G, The Staff's Auditorium]]

Controlled by [[Roskinov Entreal (Player Notes)]]

Description: Grand theater in the center. Most buildings are uncanny, a little too big for its purpose, the doorway oddly shaped or not quite big enough for most species. Citizens are walking through, most wearing theater masks. They're friendly.

Session 4 Notes:
Should the players decide to go towards the main theater, they will be stopped by [[Roskinov Entreal|Roskinov]]. They will greet them, their voice annunciated like speaking to a crowd of unseen observers. They will invite the party to a mock duel to "left off some steam, help y'all settle in more". 

"The rules are simple. No using any external items, I'd rather not have to repair my theater *once* again, and once you get near fainting, step off to the side. Agreed? Agreed!"

He guides the party towards the main theater, nearly the size of a city block.
