Main Article: [[Sector E, Village of Mercenaries]] 

Controlled by [[Liam Osworth]]

Description: Highly forested, not very many encampments you can see, and those you find are small tents and campfires, recently extinguished. After a few minutes of wandering, Liam walks out from behind one of the trees and greets the party. At the current session (session 4), they will not be wary nor hostile to any of the party members. That may change if they get involved with any of the other [[Great Fears|Fears]]. He will invite the party to a small feast them and a couple others are attending.
