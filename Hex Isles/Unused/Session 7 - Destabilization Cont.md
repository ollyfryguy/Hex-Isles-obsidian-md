Session:
During the period where the [[Combat Trials]] were being completed, [[Elizabeth Dun]] is going through the newly arrived shipment of books before he finds a "forbidden" book (one above his [[Honor]]), titled: "A Utilization and Manifestation of Fear; A Dissertation Created By Evera Stall, Formally Known as [[The Head Archivist - Evera Stall - Sparrow Goldwater|The Head Archivist of The Planar Archives]]". This is particularly strange. Not the book itself, but the fact its [[Honor]] requirement (that being 80) is so high. Usually locked books are quite clear from the cover alone as to why their locked. Either clear in their (usually bad or could be used for bad) use case, or at the very least magical in some sort. This book was neither; no magic aura and, while the topic was weird, it clearly wasent malicious. Even the fact that it was made by The Head Archivist didn't really mean much, their work was not necessarily more classified than others. As your pondering why this book was blocked, about to return it back to [[The Planar Archives|the archive]], you feel an intense feeling of being watched. Like every fiber of your being were being taken and analyzed, meticulously gone over again and again; As you black out the last thing you hear is the book tumbling to the ground along with a gravely, low voice saying: "Soon."

Moving onto [[Nova]], currently in a hospital bed. While the Cold Iron choker didnt fully restrict your magic, using your magic while wearing it does put a strain on your body. So, your currently in the hospital for Acute Mana Sickness, restrained. Nothing much to do, other than sit with your own thoughts and sleep. And as you drift off too sleep for the, like, 7th time tonight you dream. You dream of a barren landscape; rolling, desolate hills of blackened grass, wilting flowers, and empty night sky. This dream feels more... real than normal, for lack of better words. The cold night air seems to cut into you, and you feel a increasing sense of unease wrap around you like chains, weighing you down. Your eyes adjust to the faint glow of the... well, you were going to say moon before noticing there isn't one. And as you look around in clearer vision you notice where you are. A cemetary. Stone graves litter the surroundings, the inscriptions too faded by the elements to be legible. Up ahead you see a, presumably, empty clearing, where the light seems weaker, unable to penetrate as far. What does Nova do?

**If Nova Does Not Go Towards The Dark Clearing**:
Alright. As you turn away, going the other direction from the clearing a small fog apparates around you. And as you continue walking for a couple minutes it grows denser and denser to where you can barely see a foot in front of you. Continuing you feel the fog dissipate as you glance around, noticing you are back where you were at the start.

**If Nova Goes Towards The Clearing**:
Alright. As you approach the clearing you cant really see past the magical darkness. Or, well, you assume its magical darkness since your Darkvision is doing nothing. You tentatively enter the dark as it seems to envelop and swirl around you, the cold and your fear spiking slightly. You continue on for what seems like 10, maybe even 15 minutes, before you hear a loud crack. Torches you didnt know were there light up, piercing through the darkness to reveal 9 graves, all with a small illustration covering them.

From left to right, the illustrations are:
A cockroach ([[The Corruption]])
A fire. ([[The Desolation]])
An eye. ([[The Eye]])
A animal bone ([[The Flesh]])
A dragon's head. ([[The Hunt]])
A featureless, human face. ([[The Lonely]])
A spiral. ([[The Spiral]])
A theater, comedy and tragedy mask. ([[The Stranger]])
And a spiderweb. ([[The Web]]).

As you gaze upon these stone graves you hear that loud, cracking sound again. And right before you wake up you see the grave depicting an eye crack open as a dark green light emanates from it.

Now, you and Elizabeth wake up in a stone mausoleum, very old, with moss and vines peeking in through the cracked walls. 5 marble caskets lay on the edges of the room, with the names: "[[Happy]]", "[[Blaze]]", "[[Nova]]", "[[Leofric]]", and "[[Elizabeth Dun|Elizabeth]]". Up ahead a large stone door is open as you see Happy, Blaze, and a new face you guys dont recognize up ahead.

(Introductions happen for [[Leofric]]s character, the other trial happens, they meet [[Ruby Goldwater|Ruby]], check her thing for how to RP that interaction)
