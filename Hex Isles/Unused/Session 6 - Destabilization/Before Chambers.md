Last session before Ronen takes over as DM in the cycle (most likely.)

PRESESSION:
Give Ronen's new character (write down name here also) a new feat: Cumulative Studies. As many times as your current Intelligence Modifier, you can make one knowledge check in any field as if you have it trained. For example, even if you dont have Knowledge (Local) you could still make a check as if you did. This knowledge check does not have an extra modifier as if you had ranks in it, like to train a normal knowledge check.


As the court proceedings get done, they hear a commotion outside. Walking out of the court house they see townsfolk surrounding the barrier. A boat is approaching the island, but not one of Khortans royal police. Instead, this is a small rowboat with one man, fully clad in plate who, after a moments hesitation, steps through the islands barrier. Carter would you like to describe your character to us?
After downtime and initial greetings, they hear an evacuation request from the town's fantasy speakers, as a general commotion arises.

"Attention all citizens and visitors, under official order from The Council, Starkeep is to be evacuated for the time being due to unprecedented magical activity from the Leyline. We thank you for your cooperation"

Once they leave, either with the citizens as an evacuation group or they choose to just leave on their own to another city they'll be stopped by Chariot. They ask them if they could help attempt to stabilize the Leyline through their magic. If questioned as to why the Council / Chariot isnt doing the same, she'll say "Too risky. Six said council members shouldnt attempt to fix these kind of problems themselves. We might be mages but we're politicians first, yknow?"

		If they attempt to fix the Leyline, after a quick ritual (have them all roll knowledge arcana if they have it. every 5 past 10 give them an extra +2. Then have them roll spellcraft. This does nothing in acutality ) they will be transported to a large chamber.
