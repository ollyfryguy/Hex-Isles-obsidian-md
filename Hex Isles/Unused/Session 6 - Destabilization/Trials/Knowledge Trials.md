Should one of them choose to open the door, the rest will stop glowing and it will lead to a long, straight hallway (around 45ft., 15 ft wide.) There appears to be another stone door at the end of the hall, with 6 distinct segments, seeming to correspond to the 6 accompanying rooms.

When completing one of the puzzles, one of the segments of the door at the end of the hall light up, glowing that same blue color.


1st Left Door contains a riddle, carved into the wall in common.
"I can soar through the air with ease but I'm not something you'll want to seize. My namesakes are scattered across the sky. If I catch your eye, its lights out--goodbye." There also lays a wooden table, with an iron ingot and a fabricate scroll. If the party creates a throwing star with the fabricate scroll, the puzzle is completed, and the carved riddle will glow a white light. If the party creates the wrong object with the fabricate scroll, or otherwise loses the materials, a trapdoor will open in the roof, dispensing the lost materials. Upon successfully completing the puzzle, some tiles in the main hallway turn to trapped tiles, causing throwing stars to shoot out from the wall at whoever was standing there. Upon a failed reflex save (DC 15), 2 shurikens (https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Shuriken) hit the creature, dealing 2d3 damage. If traps or tiles are actively looked for (with a DC 20 search check) they find which tiles are trapped.

1st Right Door contains a puzzle, along with an adamantine door and key hole.
"This room is filled to the brim with rows of shelves and piles of open crates, all of them filled with all kinds of assorted mundane household objects and cheap adventuring gear--coils of rope; candles; dinner plates; taxidermied beasts including a raccoon, a badger, a fox, and a fawn; gardening tools; and the like. A single leather-bound book lies open in the small circular chamber, in the middle, as if deliberately placed there."

The book reads "The key you seek is here somewhere. Do not be so hasty, or look past what's right there. We all have one. Some big, some small, some long and tall, and even when its stuffed it can run." The answer to the riddle is nose, and once a player says out loud that answer as a guess, they will feel an itching sensation in one of their nostrils, causing them to sneeze out a bronze key, which will open up the adamantine door, into a small closet with a red switch. Upon flicking it, the puzzle is completed and the book alights with the same white glow.

Once the puzzle is completed, a hidden door reveals itself, revealing a sand timer, which is magically turned over as the door is revealed. Inscribed throughout the entire room (walls, the timer itself, floor, etcetera) lies the words "FLIP" in red. A continuous timer starts for a minute, and if a player fails to remember to flip the timer, all creatures begin to feel their minds slip away into madness, taking 1d3 points of wisdom damage (healed after all rooms have been completed.)

2nd Left Door contains a riddle, carved into the wall in common.
The room is filled with two different kinds of items; instruments and weapons. 
"I am no artist's model, and yet you have to draw me. I'm truly awful solo; I need a partner surely. I like violence. Or is it violins? Depends on where you saw me."
When a creature picks up both the bow (weapon) and the bow (of a violin), the riddle glows the same white as before. After successfully finishing the room, on all future failed rooms, a sharp, piercing noise of a violin emanates, causing 1d6+2 Sonic Damage *to all those involved with the puzzle, generally the entire party.*

2nd Right Door
The room is made of smoothed stone, with a jade altar in the middle. Writing on the wall reads: 
"I have a tail and a head, but no legs. I am probably with you now." The answer is a coin, and when a coin (cp, sp, gp, ep, pp) is placed on the pedestal, the writing glows the same white glow as before. A copper ball falls from the ceiling in the main hall, and begins rhythmically pulsing out water from tiny holes in its surface. The players will begin to drown in 15 minutes times the amount of rooms left (4 rooms left times 15 = 60 minutes).

3rd Left Door
The room is split into two sections. On the leftmost section are stone statues, depicting a scout,  a warrior, a cleric. and a wizard, with pedestals In front of them.. On the right side are bags upon bags of different materials, from stones to animal hide to cotton. You guys even spot a lot of what are considered "special materials", like adamantine, mithral, cold iron, and the like. Engraved at the bottom of the stone statues lay the words: "With only the best may they survive.". Theres also a lever at the end of the room.

The players need to set the corresponding materials to the matching job type. **They do not need to come up with the exact material, as long as the reasoning checks out.**
A knowledge (Geology) with a DC of 20 gives them the needed material types
The answer for the Scout is **Mithral**
The answer for the warrior is **Adamantine**
The answer for the cleric is **Cloth/Leather**
The answer for the wizard is **Any Crystal**.

Pulling the lever results in the materials (and pedestal) being dropped down. If the material chosen is incorrect the material comes back up a couple seconds later. If its correct, the pedestal stays down. Once all pedestals are down the statues glow the same white color as before and the room is completed. They then hear the sliding of a stone door in the hallway. A section of the wall has slid inwards into a small 5 by 5 room. This room has a table, painted 4 colors: Top left red, Top Right blue, Bottom Right Green, Bottom Left Yellow. It also has the words: "Repeat" engraved in it, along with the words "Tap" in the middle of each color. After a few seconds, with a player in the room / able to see the puzzle, the colors light up and make a audible tone, corresponding to their color: Low pitch red, medium-low pitch Blue, medium-high pitch Green. high pitch Yellow. Every 2 minutes from now on they will hear, no matter where they are in the chambers, a sequence of those pitches, starting from one and incrementing up for each time it happens. If they fail to repeat the pattern correctly, all players take 1d6 points of sonic damage as the table emits a very high pitched, loud tone for several seconds.

As a DM, how you do this is pull up [this website](https://freesimon.org/) and have them do the first sequence. Then exit it and wait 2 minutes. Go back in and have them do it 2 times. Then exit, repeat steps.

3rd Right Door
This room is much larger than the rest, spanning a 8 by 8 area, with torches lining the walls. The room's completely empty, except for the words "Replicate what all but the brave, foolish, and Gods fear."

Should a player die in this room, they are brought back alive as by a *true resurrection* spell, and the room is completed.

This may be difficult for players to intuitively get, so try and give them some hints if they're stuck on it.

Once all puzzles are completed, and the ending door's segments shine blue, all traps come to a halt, the water in the room suddenly disappears, all previously glowing parts stop, and the door from which they came from opens back up. A booming voice, artificial in tone and inclination, states: "The Knowledge Trials have been completed." Walking outside they find a small blue key on the ground. All players are healed to full and all spellslots are regained.


**If the players fail the Knowledge Trial, usually by them all dying, they will all awake outside the trial and they are able to retry.** However it feels different this time; the air crackling with energy, it feels... unstable. Every 5 minutes a wild magic surge will go off, following the table from this website/pdf: https://centralia.aquest.com/downloads/NLRMEv2.pdf
