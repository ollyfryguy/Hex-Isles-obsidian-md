Entering the combat trial the players come across a small room. Across the walls lay a multitude of weapons, along with rations and water. Theres also an iron gate, which seems to lead way into some sort of arena. There's a lever next to it, with text above it saying: "Pull when ready". 
In the top right corner of the room on a stone desk lay 5 magical potions and oils along with a paper explaining what they do.

Potion of [Haste](https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/haste.htm) (Can make another attack with full round, +1 on atk rolls and to AC and Reflex, 30 ft speed increase to a max of double base speed. Lasts 4 rounds.)
Potion of [Protection from Arrows](https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/protectionFromArrows.htm) (10/magic, lasts 4 hours.)
Potion of [Rage](https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/rage.htm) (+2 to Str and Dex mods, +1 to Will Saves, -2 to AC, lasts 4 rounds.)
Potion of [Cure Moderate Wounds](https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/cureModerateWounds.htm)(2d8+4)
Potion of [Shield of Faith]((https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/shieldOfFaith.htm)(+4 to AC, lasts 4 minutes)

Once the lever is pulled, the iron gate opens up. The arena's floor is covered in a thin layer of sand, with marble walls encircling you all. The sky, or apparent lack thereof, glows a dark blue, with red streaks reminiscent of lightning occasionally appearing. You also see 4 buttons on each end of the arena, one near your gate, the opposing gate, and the other 2 walls.

The marble walls have a hardness of 8 and HP of 60

Since I assume it'll come up, remember that melee attacking someone who is grappling does not have a chance to hit the wrong person (unless its a ranged attack).

**Wildcard Events**
At the beginning of the match, one of the buttons will randomly light up (1d4, 1 is player gate, 2 is right wall, 3 is enemy gate, 4 is left wall). When the lit button is pressed for the first time, a announcer will say "Seems like we have a Wildcard on our hands citizens!". Pressing a button is a swift action.

All concurrent wildcard effects end when a lit button is pressed, and a new effect is rolled as per the following table:

| The arena counts as difficult terrain. If a creature stays still for two rounds, they are entangled.

| The walls of the arena, along with the gates, disappear. The buttons remain in their places, floating. If fighting along the new edge of the arena, creature must make a balance check (DC 8) to stay on. If a creature fails this balance check and falls, they can attempt a reflex save to hang on (DC 15). It takes a full round action to get back on after that, and the attacking creature can try and knock the other person off. (Str check vs a balance check with a -4).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |     3      | It seems the walls have fallen away; Make sure to not fall off, contestants!                                                 |
