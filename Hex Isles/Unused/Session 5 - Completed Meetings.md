Not much happened this session. We finished up the task force from last session (note to self, that combat was way harder than I originally anticipated, and Blaze is a menace). They then got picked up by the Planar Archives, and they met Ronens new character. Yes I forgot the name of them, f u. After then meeting with [[The Architects]], Rylee attempted to gain some money by beating up a random drug dealer and "turning him in". Currently in court due to that "drug dealer" being a part of the city guard, which they were using as a test to catch drug addicts.
