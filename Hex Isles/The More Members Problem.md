##### In here resides a list of solutions, ranked by personal preference.

### Option A:
Split normal Wednesday sessions to every other week, with the times in-between used to DM a new campaign, run by Dashel.

**Pros:**
- More time for Cash to write and plan for sessions, improving general campaign quality and consistency.
- No loss of players from any campaign.
- Less general backlash against the decision, in comparison to Option B.
- The more casual style of the Wednesday campaign is generally better for a 'every other week' schedule, in comparison to Hex Isles.
- Experienced DM for new campaign.
**Cons**:
-  Lack of preference from Cash; indifference from other players. "Preferably Option D but I'm still fine with Option A" - Cash

### Option B:
Split Thursday sessions to every other week, with the time in-between Hex Isles spent to DM a new campaign, run by Dashel.
**Pros**:
- *Continuation of Thursday sessions into the robotics season* (as opposed to the otherwise full cancellation that will occur). Thus, total session count for the school year remains roughly consistent with current schedule, and no multiple month stoppage of the club.
- No loss of players from any campaign.
- More time to write sessions for Hex Isles, basically making the chance I cancel a session due to lack of prior writing zero.
- Experienced DM for new campaign.
**Cons**:
- Dislike of this idea from some Hex Isles members (Damien comes to mind first)

### Option C:
Allow Jason to run a campaign on Thursday at the same time in the room.
**Pros**:
- Current Wednesday and Thursday session continue on current schedule.
- Allows for most amount of new players joining.
- No loss of players from any campaign.
- Will most likely be run in 5e, which newcomers will (most likely) be used to.
**Cons**:
- Nobody but new players in the new campaign.
- Lack of DND system experience and/or storytelling ability may become problematic.
- General noise chaos from having two campaigns running simultaneously in the same room.

### Option D:
D&D Club extends its days of operation to a new day, to either Friday or Monday, with Dashel (or Jason) running the new campaign.
**Pros**:
 - No loss of players from any campaign
 - Current campaigns continue on current schedule.
 - Experienced DM running new campaign (ignore if Jason is running)
 - Allows for most amount of new players joining.
 - "More Flexible"
**Cons**:
- Most likely incompatible with Dashel's schedule, making this option not possible (if he is DMing), or simply making him unable to join.
- Makes D&D Club even more incompatible with afterschool activities; Olly is unable to join.
- Makes D&D Club more incompatible with clubs in general.
### Option E:
Dashel leaves either Hex Isles of Red Hand of Doom (Wednesday) to run a campaign simultaneously on either day.
**Pros:**
- Current campaigns continue on current schedule.
- Experienced DM running new campaign.
- Allows for most amount of new players joining.
**Cons**:
 - Loss of Dashel as a player in either Wednesday or Thursday campaign.
 - Either nobody but new players in new campaign, or more than just Dashel leaving either Wednesday or Thursday campaign.
 - Requires *large* rewrite of Hex Isle's notes and assumed plot direction, probably halting sessions for a couple of weeks. (Applicable to Thursday only)
 - General noise chaos from having two campaigns running simultaneously in the same room.
