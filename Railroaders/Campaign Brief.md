**Story Wise:**

- Campaign Name: "Railroaders"
- The world is fine. Average. Here, there's no evil demon kings or monsters invading nearby towns or even governments corrupt enough to warrant an immediate uprising. 'Adventurer' is more something you put on your job application because 'Unemployed' sounds worse, rather than an actual position. Because there's simply nothing left to adventure anymore. Most threats have been defeated, dungeons explored, and loot pilfered.
- Not _every_ universe, timeline, and offshoot of reality is like that, however.
- Cue the [[Nexus Institute]] (title subject to change). A cool sounding name for an underpaid, nonprofit research facility, currently hiring adventurers, past and old.
- In their words, every universe has a script. A loose set of rules and parameters that govern what is expected to happen in that universe— what events are "destined" to happen, so to speak. And if a timeline begins to differ from that script, their reality begins to break down.
- Your job, as an adventurer employed by this company, is to ensure the stability of those collapsing realms, nudging the course of events to something more accurately resembling the reality's "script".
- Or in the worse case scenarios, rescuing unafflicted individuals; getting them out of the collapsing dimension out before it fully deteriorates.

**Mechanics Wise:**

- Starting at level 5. AKA the level of Hex Isle's characters already if my memory serves me right (which could very well be false).
- As per usual, all books are allowed. Ask me first if you'd like to use content from a web enhancement. Also ask me first if your content hinges on a new mechanic (ex: Eberron's 'Action Points', 'Incarnum' from Magic of Incarnum, etc.)
- If you want to play an evil alignment, talk to me first.
- Ask me about homebrew in advance, and expect me to reject it
