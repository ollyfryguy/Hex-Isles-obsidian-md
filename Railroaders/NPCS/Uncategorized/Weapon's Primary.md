Patron of [[Arsa Null]]

The prior major deity of weapon creation and use. Was banished from its divine realm after meddling too much in mortal affairs, creating weapons too powerful for mortal hands to create, and distributing them to the commanders of an army it (and a few other Gods) were allied with. 

As punishment, "Weapons Primary" lost most of their divine power, personable traits (name, sex), was imprisoned in the inner heart of Mechanus, and most importantly of all, cursed so that no mortal being would ever use weapon's influenced by Weapon's Primary of their own volition.

Nowadays, a few millennia later, Weapon's Primary is attempting to regain some of its power. It has made a contract with [[Arsa Null]], where he is forced to use weapon's enchanted (and thus influenced) by Weapon's Primary, in exchange for powerful enchants to his weapons.
