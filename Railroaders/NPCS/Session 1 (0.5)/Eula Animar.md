The sheriff of the Crassly small town. A tiefling woman, with crimson skin and yellow eyes.

Acts all tough and mighty but as soon as shit hits the fan is very much a scaredy cat. Tried to hype herself up to fend off the intruders of her town, but instead hid behind a secret door of her office as they ransacked the place.
