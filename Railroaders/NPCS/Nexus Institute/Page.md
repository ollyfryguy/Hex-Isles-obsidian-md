Standing for **"Personal Assistant, Guide, and Expert**."

"And a construct rather excitedly flies out from his pocket. She looks to be a mechanical finch, made of brass and adamantine accents. Her eyes are basically green glowing LEDs, and she's currently flapping her wings and hovering next to his shoulder, her voice kinda crackly, like played out of an old speaker. 'Hi! Happy to meet you all.'"

Page, from a canon perspective, is made out of "soul shards", a Nexus made technology aimed to harness the leftover energy from a recently deceased person to be used later. After she was created, her memory was altered to not include those of any former persons (though she *does* occasionally have flashbacks or moments of recognition), and she was programmed with the knowledge she currently has, to act as adventurer's guides.

This Page in particular is part of the trial run Nexus institute is doing, to see if this concept works. There are no other Page's currently constructed.

While Nexus engineers and artificers assumed Page was non-sentient, and were correct at her initial construction, she now is. She is hiding this fact to the best of her ability and acting as if she is not sentient. See [[Sentience (Subplot)]].

#### Mechanics Wise:
Race Info:
 - 80ft Fly Speed, 5ft Walk
 - Diminutive Size
 - Modified Living Construct Subtype
	 - Immunity to any effect that requires a [Fortitude](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Saving_Throw "SRD:Saving Throw") save (unless the effect also works on objects, or is harmless). In those cases, the save is converted to Will.
	 - Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, disease, nausea, fatigue, exhaustion, effects that cause the sickened condition, and energy drain.
	 - Unlike other constructs, Page is not immune to mind-affecting spells and abilities.
	 - Darkvision out to 120 feet.
	 - Cannot directly heal damage from positive energy (aka cure spells, in most cases), though can heal from construct specific healing (such as the *repair* line of spells). Page heals 1d3/spell level for all spells casted on her (apart from spells she casts on herself). If intentionally sleeping next to a magic item, that magic item will be disabled for 10 rounds and Page will heal like a normal living creature after a rest. Potions heal as much as its equivalent cure spell
	 - Not at risk of death from massive damage. - Page responds slightly differently from other living creatures when reduced to 0 hit points. When she is at 0 hit points she is disabled, just like a living creature. He can only take a single move action or standard action in each round, but strenuous activity does not risk further injury. When his hit points are less than 0 and greater than —10, Page is inert. She is unconscious and helpless, and she cannot perform any actions. However, an inert Page does not lose additional hit points unless more damage is dealt to her, as with a living creature that is stable.
	 - Since Page works on soul crystals, should they be destroyed she may be resurrected (not raised).
	 - Damage reduction 3/--
	 - The unusual physical construction of Page makes them vulnerable to certain spells and effects that normally don't affect living creatures. Page takes damage from [_heat metal_](https://dnd.arkalseif.info/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/heat-metal--2824/index.html) and [_chill metal_](https://dnd.arkalseif.info/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/chill-metal--2793/index.html) as if he were wearing metal armor. Likewise, Page is affected by [_repell metal or stone_](https://dnd.arkalseif.info/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/repel-metal-or-stone--2354/index.html) as if he were wearing metal armor. The brass in the body of Page makes her vulnerable to [_rusting grasp_](https://dnd.arkalseif.info/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/rusting-grasp--2867/index.html). The creature takes 2d6 points of damage from the spell (Reflex half; save DC 14 + caster's ability modifier). Page takes the same damage from a rust monster's touch (Reflex DC 17 half). Spells such as [_stone to flesh_](https://dnd.arkalseif.info/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/stone-to-flesh--2882/index.html), [_stone shape_](https://dnd.arkalseif.info/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/stone-shape--2881/index.html), [_warp wood_](https://dnd.arkalseif.info/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/warp-wood--2892/index.html), and [_wood shape_](https://dnd.arkalseif.info/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/wood-shape--2897/index.html) affect objects only, and thus cannot be used on the stone and wood parts of Page
	 - Unlike other constructs, Page are subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, stunning, ability damage, ability drain (not death effects or necromancy).
- BAB is lowered as if Page was 5 levels lower. Saves are unmodified.
