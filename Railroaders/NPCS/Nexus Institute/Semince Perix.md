Employee of the [[Nexus Institute]]'s psychology branch.

## Description
A young, male satyr, standing in at around 5'7. He's wearing a mix of hastily thrown on professional clothing: an unbuttoned lab coat and tie, along with some clothing that *technically* doesn't qualify as pajamas. And on his lab coat is a yellow pin with a white outline of a stylized human brain on there.

Is the one to first introduce the party to the Nexus Institute.
## Quirks & Personality
- Always feels the need to say his full name when introducing himself.
- Doesn't do well with the cold. Got frostbite as a kid when he got trapped in a newly renovated dungeon and has disliked it ever since.
- Often deflects to how other people are feeling in times of stress or when his own personal problems come up.
