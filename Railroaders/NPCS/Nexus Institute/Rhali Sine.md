"The first thing you all notice is that she seems to be made entirely of yarn. Mostly purple, but you all spot some white, red and black accents. She's humanoid, and for a second you guess she might be human apart from the yarn, but on her face you can see two small fangs poking out from her mouth, and her eyes are instead just black lenses, like you would see on a spider." - Her universes version of a half Aranea.
