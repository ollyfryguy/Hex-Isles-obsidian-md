~~A 40 year old human woman, with seemingly permanent eye bags. She looks like she hasn't slept in a few days. She's wearing a lab coat, buttoned up and ironed, with a blue pin on the right side, with a stylized potion bottle.~~

Pronouns:
Any. Whatever fit, they suppose.

Description:
Sedona is a changeling, though they're almost never in their base form. Whenever they get bored, they change their form and name to someone else. However, they also have aphantasia (a lack of the mind's eye). No matter what form, they're always wearing their lab coat, nearly always in pristine condition, with a blue pin on the right side, depicting a stylized potion bottle (Research's symbol). They also have a pocket notebook with them at most times with elaborate written descriptions of people (they can't draw for shit).

They're fine with whatever, name wise. A new form usually means a new name, but they don't care either way if people use one of their old ones, or even a name they haven't used yet. Meaning that nearly everyone around the institute calls them something different. They find it funny.
