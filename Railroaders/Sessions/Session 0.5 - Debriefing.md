#### Things to cover in presession:
 - Ruling on "secret sections" (AKA: Pulling people outside to talk about something only their character notices).
 - Secret death saves
 - New (Fixed) ruling on grappling
 - Ask if the table wants "confirming critical hits" to be a thing, as per the actual rules of the game.
	 - If they aren't: If you or a creature roll to attack and land inside your crit range, you crit against the target. (If they choose this, Bone Crusher and all other manuevers which add to confirming criticals add to the damage after a critical. In Bone Crusher's situation, +10 to damage after critical calculation).
	 - If they are: If you or a creature roll to attack and land inside your crit range, you hit the target. You then roll *again*, with the same bonuses as last time, against their AC, to see if you actually crit. On a failure with that second roll, you hit normally instead.

## Beginning of Session

Start with the week prior (or in [[Blaze]]'s and Rylee's case, a day prior), and say how everyone first got invited to Nexus.

 - [[Blaze]]: Turns out toppling multiple governments is rather difficult. During your time in Hex Isles, while you and your party made some progress towards your eventual goal of acquiring each of the artifacts and removing the barrier, it wasn't a lot. Not much you or your party could have done with the resources available.
	 - And then, you began to notice something rather strange begin affecting people and things over the island. It was minor things at first: maybe the shopkeeper you had previously talked to didn't remember you, or an item you swore you had in your pockets suddenly vanished. But then people you had talked to rather frequently forget who you were, or perhaps they just seemed to loose a lot of depth in personality that they otherwise had. This "condition" worsened for about a year, with seemingly only you and the small group of members you traveled with even noticing. Until the patches began appearing.
 - Rylee: Nearly the same thing happened with your universe. Though more physical. The first thing your character noticed was missing buildings. Places you had rather frequented were just... conveniently missing. Just an empty spot where they once were. And no one seemed to really take notice, apart from you and some of your friends. Every time you brought it up, people either seemed to not remember anything being there to begin with, or just forget what you guys were talking about. And that just continued to increase, until instead of the spots just not being there, a white void was there instead. And no one seemed to notice. Once again, they continued, until much like Blaze, a team of adventurers, lacking augments, evacuated you from the area, when the city had more spots of void than actual city.
