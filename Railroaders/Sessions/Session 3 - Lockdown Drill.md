The party gets back from [[Dimension Prohibition (EZ19)]], with [[Terring 'Sunny' Cardinal]] and [[Semince Perix]] greeting everyone at the portal room. Seminice leads [[Nina 'Dolly' Newsie]] away to explain things more in depth, and Terring takes everyone's new items (AKA guns).

The party doesn't have a mission tomorrow, so everyone gets some downtime. Should [[Arsa Null]] meet with research to try and get his gun back, he'll find all of them have been transformed into 3rd level magic missle wands, with all of their charges.

[[Sedona Monsoon|Monsoon]] appears as a water genasi, wearing his signature lab coat, and the pin of research's department.

If [[Blaze]] doesn't try and talk to [[Lizzie Hexam]] about joining maintenance, she'll bring it up the next time she gets lunch.

The party will also all find in their respective personal rooms the note:

---
"You all find attached to the bottom of your room's ordering scroll a paper note glued onto the bottom.

`If you have any questions pertaining to the Nexus Institute or something related to it, feel free to write them on the following lines. I'll do my best to answer, or send the question off to someone who can! - P.A.G.E`

After finishing your question, what you wrote disappears, and a sticker of a green checkmark is glued onto the bottom of the page."

---

Nearing the end of the day, [[Lizzie Hexam]] will speak to every staff member individually, saying that there's a meeting tomorrow at 3:00-- meeting room's on the 2nd floor, near psychology's offices.

The next day, at the given time, every except Lizzie and PAGE is there. [[Aberis Fangmouth]] arrives 10 minutes early. Finally, Lizzie explains the lockdown drill and everyone leaves to their designated spots (Adjusters to the Portal Room).


## Actual Session

Alarms blare, and the beginning is similar to a normal lockdown drill. After 10 or so minutes, Terring unlocks the door, saying they're clear, and to just wait a few more minutes for everything to calm down.

However, after this, Lizzie comes on the site intercom, saying that theres a few unidentified threats in the site, and that the lockdown is remaining in place, before the feed abruptly cuts off.
	"...And now we're off script. Best of luck." Terring says casually, before disappearing.

The creatures present are all threats *each staff member* have fought before. Including the ones not from Baseline reality. They're spread strategically throughout the building so that most people have to fight other staff member's creatures.

3rd Floor:
[[Rhali Sine|Rhali]]'s: A normal spellcaster, albeit with the ability to disrupt Soul Threads. Apart of the Weaver's cult (or, a variation of it at the least). PG 27, Enemies and Allies, with the ability to disrupt any soul thread with a DC 20 Will save to resist.

[[Aberis Fangmouth]]'s: Pseudodragon, currently hiding from the hells outside. Pg 210 of MM1

[[Semince Perix]]'s: Warforged, though theres a large crystal embedded into its back (dominate monster). Pg 190 MM3


2nd Floor: 
[[Lizzie Hexam]]'s: A large dragon. Can't tell what color it is because the color of its hide consistently distorts and flickers. (Like viewed from a bad camera). The party does know that they almost certaintly aren't winning a fight with it. Use Adult Black Dragon Stats, [here](https://www.imarvintpa.com/dndlive/Monsters.php?ID=214)

[[Sedona Monsoon|Klein]]'s: A modified doppelganger-- meant to replace not through appearance, but memory alteration. They emit pheromones', which quickly disperse through a room, modifying someone's memories to believe them to be what makes most logical sense -- in this case, Klein herself. DC 22 Fortitude save. Appears in the form described above. Actual Klein is down on the 1st floor, in the cafeteria. Attempts to make the party fight their allies (though not the other party members)
