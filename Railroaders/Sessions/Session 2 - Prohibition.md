### Start of Session - Downtime
The party has **2** days of downtime until their next mission. During this downtime, [[Semince Perix|Semince]] speaks with Blaze on getting him accustomed to their world through physical therapy.

Rhali's door has a note outside, saying to find her in [[Lizzie Hexam|Lizzie]]'s office if anyone wants to speak to her. If investigated, Rhali is watching over the security cameras, with Lizzie sorting through mail in the corner on a bedroll, some of [[Blaze]]'s extra food from a day or so ago sitting next to her.

"She won't let me work."

"You're supposed to be resting, dear."

### Mid-Early Session - Mission Start
The party is shown the dimension map. A projected image, as *Silent Image*, showing all the dimensions currently within accessible range. Grayed out dots are dimensions with a current [[Decay Percentage]] of at or higher than 75%. Dots turn progressively more red the farther they are from Baseline (and thus the more energy it takes to transfer there).

Clicking on a dot shows that dimension's stats.

When they're actually ready to go into the dimension, Page states that they can't be spotted there, due to constructs of her type not existing there. She asks to tag along with someone else in there head to guide the rest of the party.

Her green orbs go out, and [[Semince Perix|Semince]] takes out a crystal orb, made of multicolored shards, handing it to whichever party member agreed. When touching the orb (not necessarily through skin contact), they can hear Page, and Page can cast spells through them.

Other than the effects described previously, Page acts as a Raven familiar of 1st Level.
