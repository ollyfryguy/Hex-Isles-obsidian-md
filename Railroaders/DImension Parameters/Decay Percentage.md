The current percentage of the realm or afflicted area's deterioration.

At a certain point of Decay Percentage, a dimension is considered past its 'Repairable Threshold'. Once reached, operatives can no longer set the [[Decay Rate]] to Zero or slower rates. Mission objective in nearly all cases then becomes rescuing unafflicted persons before deterioration makes the realm untraversable or otherwise inaccessible.

#### Repairable Threshold - Up to 75%

#### Inaccessible Threshold - Up to 90%.
