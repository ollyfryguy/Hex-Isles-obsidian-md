The inherent safety (or lack thereof) of a given [[Dimension]]. Risk Level does not necessarily mean the entire dimension's risk level, but the general area in which Operatives are sent into.


### -2: ###
Dimension is inherently, objectively safe *in all aspects,* usually due to an inherent property of itself. For example, a dimension where injury by objectivity is unable to occur.
### -1: ###
Dimension is inherently, objectively safe *to some degree*, usually due to an inherent property of itself. For example, a dimension where violence and physical harm is unable to be acted on.

### 0: ###
Dimension is considered the same (or closest to) the risk level of [[Dimension 0 - Baseline|Baseline Reality]], taken from the locational point of . I.E-- relative peace, no major threats.

### 1: ###
Dimension is considered . I.E; 

### 3: ###

### 4: ###
Dimension is considered highly deadly to any operatives, usually due to existing combat collateral or inherent property. I.E-- active warzone, lack of oxygen
### 5: ###
Dimension is considered highly deadly to any operatives, usually due to a targeted approach. I.E-- operatives are considered ideologically evil, and thus actively hunted.
### 6: ###
Dimension where its inherent properties prevents the further existence or life of creatures or a subset of creatures, usually causing the inaccessibility of that dimension. For example, a dimension where living organisms by nature cannot exist. In most cases, this Level 6 is preceded by a different Risk Level, followed by this Risk Level and a descriptor of what types of creatures are affected. I.E, "0, 6 - CONSTRUCT" referring to a dimension generally safe apart from constructs, which by nature cannot exist.
