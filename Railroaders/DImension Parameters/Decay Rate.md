The current speed in which [[Decay Percentage]] is increasing, in general.
#### Reversing
Decay Percentage is being lowered at a speed.

#### Zero
Decay Percentage is not increasing or decreasing at all.

#### Slow
Decay Percentage is increasing slowly. From a 0% initial percentage, dimension can be expected to be decayed past inaccessible threshold (75%) in 2+ years.

#### Average
Decay percentage is increasing at standard rate. From a 0% initial percentage, dimension can be expected to be decayed past repairable threshold in 9 months to 1.5 years.

#### Fast
Decay percentage is increasing at higher than average rate. From a 0% initial percentage, dimension can be expected to be decayed past repairable threshold in 3-9 months.

#### Rapid
Decay percentage is increasing at a rapid rate. From a 0% initial percentage, dimension can be expected to be decayed past repairable threshold in 0.5-3 months.

#### Critical
Decay Rate has reached critical speeds. From a 0% initial percentage, dimension can be expected to be decayed past repairable threshold in days to a couple of weeks.

### Expected
The "Expected" Decay rate is always followed by a dash and a different decay rate. This rate is exclusively used when active decay has not started yet (and is thus, Zero), but is expected to in the future.
