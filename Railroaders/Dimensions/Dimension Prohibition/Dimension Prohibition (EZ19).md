	[[Session 2 - Prohibition]]

[[Risk Level]]: 2
[[Decay Percentage]]: 0%
[[Decay Rate]]: Expected - Average
[[Description Brief]]: Dimension's script revolves around the concept of alcohol and the general concept of liquor. The ruling government, a democracy, has outlawed the trading of liquor, and all liquor directly (through drinking) or indirectly (through touching the container its in) touched is turned to normal water, as per the Purify Food and Drink spell. Decay is expected to start within the next few weeks from the person "[[Nina 'Dolly' Newsie|Nina Newsie]]"; she works for a loosely organized crime group, who attempt to gather drinkable liquor and prevent it from being purified, before using it either recreationally or for sale.

Dimension is set in the material plane, albeit much less magically concentrated then baseline. The current members of the Nexus Institute are most likely some of the strongest in the town of Oakhurst. More specifically, all teleportation magic seems completely inoperable here. Constructs are not known to exist.

Persons should attempt to find who Nina is and transfer them to Baseline, peacefully. [[Adjusters]] can expect a mission from Nina to both gain her trust, and continue the current script.


### Actual Description
The party finds themselves in an moon lit alleyway upon arrival. Each building is tall, at least three stories high, made of stone, steel and concrete. The streets, walking out, are equally lit, and people in fine clothing can be seen walking around.
