[[Description Brief]] - Dimension's script revolves around a group of chosen heroes stopping the imminent rise of a new Demon Lord from the depths of the abyss, by securing allies with the nearby kingdoms and cutting off means of available worship, usually through violent means. Decay is currently due to the "chosen heroes" killing every creature they come across, regardless if they were considered ally or enemy. Operatives should gather more information on the group, before attempting a group assassination, in this Scouter's opinion.

## Actual Description
The location the party is dropped into is a desert. The sand, coarse under everyone's feet, is black, with occasional streaks of pink and normal yellow in straight lines. There's a town around you all, primarily wooden. The kind of wood with barely any detail or blemishes that you all can tell was made with magic. And there's nobody out here. Not a single soul in sight.

Its also surprisingly a very average temperature here. Maybe like, 65 Fahrenheit.

Types of buildings:
 - Enclosed Saloon (Left)
 - A general purpose store (Left, next to Saloon). 
 - Sealed off, man made tunnel directly behind the party.
	 - Leads to a large natural reservoir; clearly where the town gets their water from.
 - A few houses off to the right
 - And a large central building directly in front of you all, some ways down the road. Looks to be a mix between a sheriff's office and a guard house. Clearly ransacked; you can see the front door is broken open.
