## Progression
In addition to the normal benefits of his class, Blaze gains the following feats (in order) at 2nd level and every 3 levels after.

### Divine Source (Metamagic)
 - The damage type of the given fire spell is changed to "Divine" for means of bypassing immunities, resistances, damage reduction, and the like. This pseudo-damage-type-change does not apply to a creature's potential vulnerabilities. If a feat or ability usually only applies to spells dealing fire damage, they still apply in this case. This ability can be used a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Spellcasting Modifier.

### Pyrotechnics
 - You gain greater control over sources of flame. As a standard action (unless specified otherwise), gain the ability to perform these abilities:
	 - Extinguish any nonmagical fire(s) within a 5-ft cube/level area or on one creature/2 levels after 1st, within a Medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft./level). This ability also works regarding magical fires created by Blaze (though not fires with the "Divine Source" Metamagic applied to them).
	 - Change the color of any particular fire source for 1 hour. This effects all fire created by the source after this ability. Swift action, or can be applied to a spell about to be cast like a Metamagic feat.
	 - Move an active fire source to any other solid point of contact within Close range (25 + 5 ft./2 levels), centered on Blaze. If moving a fire source onto a creature, that creature is allowed a reflex save (DC 15 + 1 every 2 levels after and including 3rd) to dodge. The object/creature the source was moved from is quickly extinguished. This ability works on fire elementals and other creatures made entirely of flame, which if unwilling are allowed a Will save (DC 13) to resist.
	 - Sense sources of flame within a 120ft sphere. Concentration DC 12.
	 - Create any common sounds of fire, as *Ghost Sound*. Will disbelief DC 12 (if interacted with).

### Fiery Lineage
 - You gain the benefits of the feat *Bloodline of fire* from *Player's Guide to Faerun*, with the save bonus replaced. The full description is as follows:
	 - All spells with the fire descriptor are casted at +2 caster level. In addition, you gain the ability to heat up your skin to extreme temperatures, dealing 1d4+1 fire damage to all creatures in prolonged contact with you (such as with a Grapple). This temperature does not hurt you in any way, and once activated (Swift, mental) does not require concentration to sustain, lasting until intentionally disabled.
