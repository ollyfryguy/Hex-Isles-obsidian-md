A kitsune, who's currently a "member" of Botany at the [[Nexus Institute]]. Doesn't like saying she's the head of the department. "Feels wrong..."

3rd Level Truenamer.

1st Feat: Name Sight (Homebrew):
	"To all creatures within sight and 15 feet, you subconsciously get a glimpse of their true name. This acts as like you were attempting to discover a creature's personal truename (ToM 197) and got a singular success, though its performed as a nonaction costing no gold pieces. The application of this feat is involuntary; apart from removing the conditions for the effect to activate (such as through blindness), this effect always occurs."

She doesn't know *all* of [[Blaze]]'s true name, but enough of it to know something is *very off* about him. She feels somewhat uncomfortable around him as a result. She tries to hide it. She's bad at it.
